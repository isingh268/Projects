        "The motivation for this project was to predict stock price movements within the health care sector following earnings calls due to the impact that these quarterly earnings calls have on market perception and investor sentiment. I selected fourth quarter earnings calls due to the fact that they often consist of annual summaries and forward-looking statements providing a unique insight into the financial health and strategic direction of a company. This project, therefore, aims to use a combination of financial and linguistic information discolsed in the earnings calls to predict susbsequent stock price movements. My goal is to only to have an accurate forecast of subsequent stock price but to also understand what factors influence investor behavior in a critical and volatile sector such as health care.\n",

        "The structure of the notebook will start with making the dataframe and all the parts of the data preprocessing that happened in that process. From there, I will be testing out various models that will attempt to predict stock price direction after earnings calls."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question.[Operator instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nSteve Tanal -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, vice president of investor relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, president and CEO; and Mark Kaye, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon, Morgan Kendrick, president of our commercial health benefits business; and Felicia Norwood, president of our government health benefits business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and year and recent progress against our strategic initiatives.\\nMark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com.\\nWe will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC.\\nI will now turn the call over to Gail. \\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered a strong end to 2023, demonstrating our ability to execute with agility and the balance and resilience of our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62. For the full year, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $25.22 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14.\\n2023 marks the sixth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate with a compound annual growth rate exceeding the high end of the range. This reflects the ongoing execution of our strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities, and optimize our health benefits business. In 2023, we made significant strides building upon our flywheel for growth. Carelon has and will continue to add attractive capabilities that we can scale rapidly and sustainably over the long term.\\nFor example, just a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a company specializing in infusible and injectable therapies. The acquisition expands our capabilities catering to consumers with complex and chronic needs who can benefit the most from our approach to whole-person health. Infusion services will complement our suite of pharmacy services which, today, include a fast-growing specialty pharmacy business and our advanced home delivery service, which launched at the beginning of this year. Carelon Services is poised for strong growth in 2024 with the onboarding of new clients and continued expansion of services provided to Elevance Health medical members, including the rollout of risk-based oncology products and Carelon Insights, as well as the launch of comprehensive Carelon behavioral health management services to address the whole health needs of Medicaid beneficiaries living with serious mental illness.\\nTurning to our health benefits business. 2023 marked another strong year despite a dynamic operating environment. Performance was led by the optimization of our commercial business, where our operating margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows, which will continue into 2025. Commercial customers prioritize affordability, experience, and simplicity, and we're delivering on all fronts.\\nIn 2023, a we launched a series of initiatives designed to improve and simplify the customer experience, including our associates' ability to better serve our members through the integration of AI support and natural language processing, which has significantly improved first call resolution, in addition to enhancing our claims auto-adjudication rate. We're also broadening the use of AI to automate certain aspects of our provider directory and other administrative processes, which have improved data accuracy in consumer and provider experiences. Momentum in our national accounts business is a direct result of the unique and differentiated value we offer to large employers. We continue to consolidate business with existing clients, achieving excellent retention and winning over 75% of employers who ultimately switch carriers despite a smaller pipeline of new accounts for 2024.\\nIn our individual business, we positioned our products thoughtfully to drive profitable and sustainable growth, and we're pleased with our performance in 2023. We're looking forward to even stronger membership growth this year as we focus on maximizing access to care for redetermined Medicaid beneficiaries. Our relentless focus on affordable products, superior customer experiences, and simplicity is yielding strong results. After growing commercial membership by over 400,000 members last year, we are poised to grow by another 750,000 in 2024.\\nMedicaid eligibility redeterminations remain ongoing and, in many states, have accelerated their redetermination processes. To date, over 70% of our members who lost Medicaid coverage were unenrolled for administrative reasons. This is a challenging reality for many families, but we're encouraged that we are nearly two-thirds of the way through the process. With close to 30% of those unenrolled before September 1st having reenrolled in an Elevance Health product.\\nOur research indicates that many unenrolled members are facing barriers to reenrollment including awareness of the process and required actions to maintain coverage. To address this, we're executing an extensive renewal campaign and have reached over 3 million people with our omnichannel approach as we remain committed to supporting them as their trusted health partner. Despite accelerated membership attrition from redeterminations to date, our Medicaid business is performing well. Grades remain actuarially sound for the members we are privileged to serve, and we are innovating to meet their needs.\\nFor example, in 2024, we will expand our community connected care model into eight additional states. This program assists Medicaid members with their health-related social needs by identifying gaps and connecting members to support services in their communities. We will also launch a program in alliance with the affordable connectivity program, major wireless carriers, and Samsung that will help increase equitable access to digital and virtual health tools. The program will provide eligible Medicaid members with a curated selection of digital and virtual health tools via smartphone with no data cap at no cost, along with training materials and ongoing guidance on how to use these tools.\\nStrong performance in 2023 allowed us to invest for the long term. In the fourth quarter, these investments were concentrated in Medicare, where we remain intensely focused on building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth. This includes improving our star quality ratings and driving profitable growth in markets where we know we can win over the long term. Unfortunately, pockets of the Medicare Advantage market have remained hyper competitive despite a more challenging funding environment.\\nWhile our plans continue to offer attractive and valuable benefits, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to address product sustainability, and as such, we experienced greater-than-expected attrition in certain markets. As a result, we expect our Medicare Advantage membership to be roughly flat in 2024 on an organic basis but earnings to improve. Importantly, cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business continued to develop as we expected, and we are confident that the assumptions underlying our bids for 2024 are appropriate. With respect to stars, we have now fully implemented My Health Advocate, our comprehensive, personalized customer service model for Medicare.\\nThis has improved experiences for our members, helping them to easily navigate the healthcare system and their plan benefits. Early proof points reflect an improvement in first call resolution, a key indicator of future quality performance for our Medicare Advantage plans. We are confident that we have a solid foundation in our health benefits business, from which we will grow Carelon for the long term with many of the building blocks in place to accelerate our enterprise flywheel for growth. We are positioned to deliver another year of strong earnings growth in line with our long-term target in 2024, while continuing to invest in our future.\\nWe expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than $37.10 this year, reflecting growth of at least 12% over 2023. Finally, advancing health equity is foundational to our efforts to improve the health and lives of the individuals and communities we are privileged to serve. Our industry-leading approach received renewed recognition when the National Committee for Quality Assurance awarded its newly established health equity accreditation plus to 20 of Elevance Health-affiliated Medicaid health plans covering over 90% of our Medicaid members and making us the only national plan to have received this distinction to date. We also saw excellent progress on our ambitious goal to improve maternal health equity by reducing the disparity in preterm birth rates between Black and non-Black communities, improving the disparity gap by 5.2% relative to our 2022 baseline.\\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to our extraordinary team of over 100,000 associates. It is their collective passion and hard work that enables us to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. This past year alone, our associates logged over 225,000 volunteer hours in our communities, a record high for Elevance Health. This remarkable achievement reflects our deep dedication to making a tangible positive impact on the lives of the people we are privileged to serve and for the communities we call home.\\nAs we move forward, we will remain focused on serving our members as their lifetime trusted health partner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our new chief financial officer, Mark Kaye. Mark?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Gail, and good morning. I am pleased to join you for my first earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. As Gail shared, we delivered strong results every quarter of 2023, including in the fourth quarter, which was marked by solid top- and bottom-line growth and significant progress in the execution of our enterprise strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities, and optimize our businesses. Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62 and full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14 were ahead of expectations.\\nSince 2018, Elevance Health has achieved a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16%, surpassing our long-term target range of 12% to 15%. Operating revenue exceeded 170 billion in 2023, up 9.3% year over year, driven by growth in both our health benefits and Carelon businesses. The benefit expense ratio was 89.2% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the full year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points and 60 basis points respectively compared to the prior-year periods. This was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend, most notably in our commercial health benefits business.\\nThe adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.6% for the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points compared to the prior-year period, driven by accelerated investments made in the quarter, notably in network quality, value-based care, and customer experience initiatives designed to address key priority areas for Medicare Advantage stars. For the full year, the adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.3%, flat year over year. Operating cash flow was 8.1 billion in 2023 or 1.3 times GAAP net income. This includes the benefit of approximately 300 million of state-based payments for 2024 dates of service that we received in the fourth quarter and which will correspondingly impact operating cash flow in 2024.\\nWe ended the year with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9% in line with our targeted range. Given confidence in our outlook, we took advantage of market volatility during the fourth quarter to accelerate share repurchases. Specifically, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for 929 million, bringing total share repurchases for the year to 5.8 million shares at a total cost of 2.7 billion. Our health benefits business ended the year with approximately 47 million members, a decrease of around 570,000 year over year, driven by attrition in Medicaid associated with eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by growth in our commercial fee-based membership.\\nToday, we are seven to eight months into the Medicaid redetermination process. And while there is significant variability by state, we believe that nearly two-thirds of our members have had their eligibility evaluated. Of those unenrolled, approximately 70% have lost coverage due to administrative reasons. And we have also seen an elongation in the time some beneficiaries have taken to reenroll into Medicaid while others have transitioned on to an ACA exchange plan.\\nAs Gail noted, we are executing an extensive renewal campaign to maximize continuity of coverage Accordingly, we expect reenrollment into Medicaid continue through at least 2024 and for growth in ACA exchange plans to accelerate. This has been incorporated into our membership guidance ranges for 2024. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024. We are pleased to provide initial guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of greater than $37.10, reflecting growth of at least 12% year over year.\\nWe are focused on optimizing our health benefits business, including through the ongoing margin recovery of our commercial risk-based business, the strategic repositioning of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings in certain markets, and the transformation of our cost structure. Further, we are investing in high-growth opportunities with a focus on establishing a foundation for sustained long-term growth. We will scale Carelon's existing capabilities and add new ones in 2024 and driving incremental earnings growth and accelerating our enterprise flywheel for growth. The momentum in our commercial health benefits and Carelon businesses is partially offset by the Medicaid membership headwinds included in our guidance.\\nWe anticipate total medical membership to end 2024 in the range of 45.8 million to 46.6 million, down approximately 750,000 year over year at the midpoint. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members, with attrition driven by the net loss of approximately 930,000 members associated with changes in our footprint discussed on our third-quarter earnings call and ongoing eligibility redeterminations. Commercial membership is expected to grow by over 750,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 32.4 million to 32.8 million members. This includes over 300,000 net new risk-based members and approximately 400,000 net new fee-based members collectively driven by new business wins and strong client retention, reflecting our resolute focus on customer affordability, experience, and simplicity.\\nMedicare Advantage membership is expected to end the year approximately flat. As a reminder, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to improve the sustainability of our product offerings, and given unexpected competitive dynamics in certain markets, experienced greater-than-expected attrition. Nonetheless, these actions will help establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long term. And we remain confident in the outlook for utilization and medical cost trends embedded in our 2024 bids.\\nFinally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits membership to remain relatively stable year over year. On a consolidated basis, operating revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up low single digits. We project operating earnings for the year to be at least 10.3 billion, reflecting 9% growth with contributions from both our health benefits and Carelon businesses, disciplined benefit management, and the successful execution of our 2023 business optimization initiatives. Please note that our guidance metrics do not include the impact of pending M&A, even though we have several transactions we expect to close this year.\\nEarnings seasonality is expected to be relatively consistent year over year with slightly more than 55% of our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first half of the year and more than half of that expected in the first quarter. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our board of directors recently approved a 10.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.63 per share. This marks our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, underscoring our commitment to delivering strong results for our shareholders and the value of our balanced and resilient business model. In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the company, and I'm looking forward to working alongside the talented and dedicated team at Elevance Health to deliver on our financial targets.\\nI look forward to meeting all of you in 2024. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Once again, we ask that each participant limit themselves to a single question to allow ample time to respond to each analyst that may wish to participate in this portion of the call. For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\\nA.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Welcome on board, Mark. Congratulations to the company for another year of meeting the growth targets. And I know it's early to talk about this, but maybe you'd have to take some steps today to ensure your positioning.\\nWith 2025, you'll have the star ratings impact to overcome. When you think about that, will the company do anything differently? How do you think about the levers you have to push to offset what appears at least on the surface to be a couple percentage points of headwind from that star ratings impact. Will you step up share repurchases, accelerate investments in Carelon? How do you think about that at this early date and the ability to sustain that 12% to 15% even into next year?\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, A.J. There's a lot in there. And as you know, '25, it's a little early to opine on '25, but I'd like to give you at least a little bit of color on how we're thinking about some of the things that you mentioned. Let me start first with star ratings.\\nBecause as we shared on the last we are intensely working. Medicare Advantage is a very important business for us, and we're strategically committed to the long term. And I will reiterate this year, we felt we took very prudent actions for a long-term sustainable business and feel good about our bids. So, that positions us well for 2025 in particular.\\nIn terms of the star ratings, again, a few things going on there. We shared on our last call that on the group business, we have a number of levers at our disposal that we are able to pull, and we're still moving forward with that. And then in terms of overall star ratings, we do think that, that's going to be a multiyear initiative. But I wanted to share -- as I shared on my early remarks that we have invested at the last part of the year, and we were investing actually prior to even the announcement.\\nWe have been successful at moving all of our business into our health advocate model, and we do know that we're seeing some early signs. We don't know where the points are going to come out, but we do feel good about the investments we're making. And again, we feel really good about where our bids have come out. Broader, let me take a little bit step further back because I think your question around 25 is broader than just Medicare Advantage and stars.\\nAs I think about '25 again, not giving guidance on '25, but we do expect to accelerate growth in 2025, and we've talked quite a bit in recent calls about our flywheel for growth, which is on our improvement in both the health benefits business and our Carelon segment. We anticipate that our health benefits business is going to continue to grow in '25 after a reset year in '24. We should see an accelerated impact to that growth, which will drive revenue for Carelon. And then Carelon also has been independently scaling its multiple new capabilities, and we'll share, I assume, even more of those on the call today.\\nAnd then finally, as you know, we took some actions at the end of last year around our disciplined operating cost efficiencies, and we expect to see even greater benefits from those as we digitize and use AI in our investments. So, honestly, I think we feel that we've positioned our business very prudently, and that the balance and resilience of our enterprise and our earnings power of our health benefits in Carelon together gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. So, just a little bit more color on where we are. Thank you very much.\\nAnd next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask about the MLR guidance for 2024. It sounds like you guys are expecting margin improvement in MA, your repositioning commercial, and Medicaid is dropping pretty meaningfully.\\nBut why is MLR only flat? I would think that we'd be seeing MLR improvement. Is there some offset in there?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning, and thank you very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the 2023 just to set the context here. So, 2023 benefit expense ratio, end of the year, slightly better than our initial expectations at that 87%. And just to remind you, that represented the 60 basis point improvement year over year as well as falling in the lower half of our initial 2023 guidance range.\\nAs it relates to 2024, we are guiding to a flat benefit expense ratio of 87%, plus-minus 50 basis points. And our outlook here reflects a consistent approach to reserves and a prudent thought process around utilization, given the dynamic operating environment, especially for our government businesses. If I take a deeper look at the underlying businesses themselves, the health benefit expense ratio reflects that intentional management action we're taking in commercial. It will continue on through into 2024 around the disciplined underwriting practices and part of our margin recovery efforts.\\nAnd then certainly, on the Medicare the advantage side, continued appropriate expectations around utilization and Medicare -- medical cost trends.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark, and thanks, Kevin, for the question. Next, question please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\\nJosh Raskin -- Nephron Research -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically around the growth in Medicare Advantage to start this year. It sounds like a little bit lower than expectations.\\nAnd I'm curious specifically in the commentary you made around pockets of competition, maybe where you're seeing that, what you think is driving that. And then any specific comments on retention relative to expectations for this year?\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks, Josh, very much for the question. And just maybe a couple of overarching comments because I think it's important that I'm going ask solution Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to comment more specifically. And I think it's important to frame that we made some very specific discipline decisions and feel really good about our bids entering into this. And Felicia, we actually exited some markets very specifically that were underperforming.\\nSo, I think you have to take that into account. But she'll provide a lot more detail on kind of where we landed this year and the perspective on the market. So, Felicia, please?\\nFelicia Norwood -- President, Government Business Division\\nSure. Good morning, Josh, and thank you very much for that question. As we headed into 2024, we made some very disciplined decisions that we were going to enhance the financial performance for our Medicaid Advantage business. In the mainland, we exited a scale noted specifically certain markets that have been underperforming for us for years.\\nAnd with the impending risk model revisions, we really saw no path to long-term attractive sustainable economics in those markets. And that really represented a decline of about 84,000 members. I also want to note that we reduced supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico, both to turn around their performance after a very challenging 2023 and to position us for the three-year phase-in of the risk model revisions, which will have a material adverse impact on Medicare Advantage on the island, in part due to the higher mix of duals that we have in Puerto Rico. So, we've reset our supplemental benefits there, and in the midst of a very highly competitive bid environment, we will see membership declines somewhere in the neighborhood of about 90,000 in 2024 in Puerto Rico.\\nNow, while the decline is larger than we expected, it certainly has bolstered our confidence in the anticipated improvement in our benefit expense ratio in Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, what we wanted to do was to establish a very strong foundation from which we can grow in Puerto Rico long term, sustainably and profitably. Back to the mainland. Selling activity for AEP was actually very strong for us as we expected.\\nWhen we exclude the planned attrition on the island that we mentioned in -- on the mainland that I mentioned earlier, our net mainland Medicare Advantage membership would be on track to grow by high single digits this year, despite encountering greater disenrollment in certain markets due to very aggressive offerings by select competitors. At the end of the day, I think that we've made very thoughtful decisions around how we're going to position our business for long-term sustainable growth going forward. And we've done the things that we've always committed to do. We expect to do very well in our blue markets.\\nWe are performing better in our blue markets than the overall growth rates, and we're very much focused on a combination of balancing that perspective between margin and membership growth. So, we feel good about how we're positioning our business going forward. And as we said earlier, in light of all of these dynamics, we'd expect to have flat membership in 2024.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\\nSarah James -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst\\nThank you. You guys have some really nice margin expansion guided to for Carelon in 2024. I was wondering if you could unpack it a little bit for us as we think through the major buckets that are causing the expansion. And then also the pacing, if it's ratable as we think about the margin expansion due 2024 and then, I guess, further out as we get to 2027.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Thank you, Sarah. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon, to comment on that. And as you know, we're excited about the real flywheel opportunity that we're seeing in Carelon.\\nSo, Pete?\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nYes. Let me -- thank you, Sarah, for the question. Let me talk about Carelon Services growth. And we are very excited about the opportunity and the progress that we're making with respect to services growth.\\nI think you saw that play through in 2023. We committed to double-digit increase on revenue, which we achieved. And as it relates to our 2024 guide, you saw that we're talking about high teens, low 20s growth. And it's really playing through our strategy that we talked about, focusing in on complexities in healthcare, high-cost spend areas, and really driving capitated risk in key areas to support our health plans.\\nIn '23, we did that with our post-acute care initiative, DME, wound care. And as we move forward into 2024, I mean, Gail mentioned this in the prepared remarks, we have new offerings that are whole health full-risk opportunities, like oncology, assuming full risk in oncology as well as in Medicaid with behavioral health with the seriously mental ill population. So, these are significant initiatives that are really propelling the trajectory of our business. I would also say that -- as it relates to external growth, we're also seeing really nice improvements from that perspective and really nice momentum.\\nOur pipeline in '23 for '24 growth was much more significant. In terms of our sales this time versus last year, we've seen a real nice trajectory in our growth. And we've had a couple of really nice notable wins with the blues. I would say that as it relates to that and the opportunity with the blues, they are doing exactly what we've talked about in the past and looking closely at some of these full-risk comprehensive offerings that we're delivering in Elevance Health.\\nAnd then very interested in that in terms of the opportunities to create predictable stable cost of care for them. So, very pleased with where we are in the trajectory of growth in Carelon.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\\nStephen Baxter -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hi, thank you. I just want to come back to the Medicaid redetermination process. So, entering 2023, we're expecting some normalization of the Medicaid outperformance that you saw in years prior.\\nCan you give us an update on where that landed in 2023 compared to your initial thinking? And then just a little bit more color on what your guidance assumes for Medicaid in 2024. Does that put you back at historical norms for margins? Or should we think -- should we be thinking about something else there? Thank you.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nStephen, thanks very much for the question. On Medicaid membership, our outlook reflects the footprint adjustments we spoke about on our third-quarter earnings call and the continued attrition due to redetermination. We believe Medicaid redeterminations are approximately two-thirds complete across our Medicaid markets. And in general, we've seen more front-loaded disenrollment, notably in a few large states that have elected to adopt accelerated processes.\\nAnd then based on the trends that we've observed relative -- or related to these marketwide coverage shifts, we have adjusted our Medicaid retention assumption to be approximately 30% of our PHE related growth. We're not planning to provide point estimates for coverage transitions generally. We do, however, believe that ACA will pick up more than initially expected. While employer group coverage will gain a little bit less than initially expected.\\nBut most importantly, these updated projections are factored into our membership guidance that we provided this morning.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\\nLance Wilkes -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\nYes, thanks. Could you talk a little bit about your value-based care strategies? And what I would be interested in is from a contracting standpoint, how are you approaching that for '24 and like MA? Are you doing any sort of renegotiation to kind of hold those value-based care providers more stable in that year given the risk adjustment changes? And then how is the priority for owning those sorts of assets in Carelon change? And what's your current outlook there? Thanks.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, Lance. It's quite a bit there. But I think let me start with our value-based strategy, we've talked about on this call a number of times, and I think I would say it's remained really consistent, but we're making a lot of very good progress on that. Overall, more than 60% are in value-based care.\\nAnd in Medicare, it's even more. Specific to your question on renegotiation, we have multiple-year arrangements with our value-based providers, and we're always looking at a couple of things. One, quite frankly, to make sure that it's a win-win and we're aligned, both on cost quality outcomes and stars. So, we spend a lot of time focusing on some of the ways that we can get data back and forth more simply.\\nWe use our -- we've integrated the way we share data back and forth, and that's really around closing gaps in care and quite frankly, simplifying the process under which we work with those providers. Our goal is to make that ubiquitous across all of our value-based providers. And so, we made a lot of progress there and dramatically improve sort of the time to action with those providers. And I think that's important because, honestly, that gives them data to act, and that improves their outcomes.\\nWe have seen our value-based providers perform better in the circumstance, and we think that that's going to remain important. In terms of our strategy around ownership, we've talked about that. We -- as you know, we do have assets inside of Carelon. I guess where I would focus you more is around the specialty high-cost complex areas of specialty because that's where we think that there's a huge differentiated focus between our technology, our clinical domain expertise, and our ability to drive trend.\\nAgain, we don't need to own the providers, but we do need to have a significant role in the enablement of those care providers, and we have spent time doing that. We launched a number of new products this year with oncology, serious mental illness, and we're getting into other areas like musculoskeletal, renal, and more. And I think that's where you see the significant spend areas accelerating, and Carelon with its assets has a great opportunity. So, we expect Carelon's care provider enablement platforms continue to contribute pretty significantly Carelon's revenue meaningfully over the longer term, and we're building those assets.\\nAnd again, I'll keep going back to my flywheel where we think that will improve the performance of our health benefit plans. There's a lot of interest in -- externally in these. And Pete mentioned, we saw some nice traction in a few of these offerings this year. So, overall, I'd say very consistent focus around our value-based care enablement, and we feel like we're getting a lot of traction.\\nAnd I would focus you a lot on the specialized care specialty care, particularly on the Carelon growth opportunity. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Two on the Medicare business.\\nFirst, you talked about Medicare cost trend developing as expected in the fourth quarter. I guess I'd be curious if there are any areas that came in higher or lower than expected and what the benefit expense guidance for 2024 assumes for Medicare cost trend? And then I guess, higher level, as you reposition the Medicare business, and I understand there's several moving pieces over the next couple of years, what's the company's current view, I guess, first of the Medicare Advantage market longer term? But then second, the membership growth and margin potential for Elevance, specifically within that market context? Thank you.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you for the question. I'm going to ask Mark to address your first question, and then I'll come back and share our long-term views on Medicare.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNathan, overall utilization in the fourth quarter developed largely in line with our expectations. And that's evidenced by our reported benefit expense ratio, which came in favorable, as you know, to consensus and really to the midpoint of our initial full-year 2023 guidance range. We did see pockets of high utilization, specifically in Medicare related to orthopedics, such as knee and hip replacements and other outpatient procedures. But this is broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost-trained assumptions.\\nSimilarly, we saw a seasonal uptick in respiratory elements, including the flu and COVID, as well as increased RC vaccinations. But again, utilizations were aligned with what we planned. We'll continue to monitor our claims trends closely, including prior authorization data. We remain confident that our Medicare Advantage bids for 2024 and our pricing commercial do reflect appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Nathan, in terms of your broader question, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. As I think about the market, we still think Medicare Advantage is a very good long-term market. And as I said, we're committed to driving sustainable performance for the long term.\\nMedicare Advantage delivers really strong differentiated value for seniors. I think you have to start there. And as you look at the aligned incentives across the system to deliver better outcomes and better care, it is very -- it's a very strong marketplace, and it continues to grow. And importantly, it's incredibly popular with seniors with greater than 50% of seniors selecting Medicare Advantage today.\\nSo, that -- against that backdrop, we know seniors value stability in their benefits year over year and the items that are most important to them. And so, we have, as you heard from us earlier, look to make sure that we are in this market for the long term balancing that stability. So, with what we know is happening in this market, we can make the right benefit decisions and again, feel that we positioned ourselves and are making the right strategic investments to improve our performance. We see this business maturing, as Mark shared in his comments as well.\\nAnd again, been very intentional about our desire or decision to exit certain programs or markets and plans where we didn't think we had a long-term sustainable path to performance. And that, combined with the risk models, made that choice and then again, reposition Puerto Rico, which we believe is still a very good market, but there were some actions that we knew we had to take. So, as we look at those decisions for the long term, as Felicia shared, our business performed when you look at the mainland and take out those exits. We had very strong selling season.\\nAgain, I think that's a testament to the value of the benefits and our position. And importantly, we do believe we can grow this business profitably even in a year with hypercompetitive markets in certain cases where we outperformed the growth in our blue markets, which, again, has always been a strategy we've had is to go deeper in our blue markets and to gain more share with the value of our brand as well as in other places. So, again, we think it's a good market. We know we have some work to do in that market, but we feel we're positioning for the long term and think that we can add distinctive value for seniors as part of our focus on whole health and continuation of coverage to stay blue for life and all of their coverage.\\nSo, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nLisa Gill -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nThanks very much, and good morning. I want to focus on margin drivers. Can you maybe just spend a little time talking about the progression in 2024, getting to those targets that you have in '25? And then secondly, when I think about the margins in CarelonRx, you talked about them improving by 40 to 60 basis points. Can you talk about what the drivers are there as well? Is that Paragon Health and BioPlus, which I would assume carry better margins? Or is there something else that's really driving that improvement as we move into '24?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLisa, thank you very much for the question. I'll talk about health benefits, and I'll pass it over to Pete in a couple of minutes to talk about Carelon. On the health benefits side, we are seeing operating margins expands or expect to expand by 25 to 50 basis points in 2024. And I think about this as really being driven by three primary categories.\\nFirst is the continued underwriting discipline and the pricing actions that we're taking in commercial. 2023 really marks the end of the first full year of our efforts to recover margins from the pandemic-era lows, and we expect those supporting initiatives really to continue through 2024 and then possibly into 2025. Second one I'd call your attention to here really relates to the Medicare margin expansion. And here, as you've heard us talk about, this is about building that strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth in 2024 and striking that balance between growth and margin.\\nAnd in 2024, we leaned a little bit more toward the margin and the growth, and you see that come through in some of our outlook projections this morning. And then the third one I'd call your attention to is really the operating expense leverage. You see that we are gaining additional incremental leverage in 2024 with our guide down to 11.1% for the operating expense ratio.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nThanks, Mark. And, Lisa, your question was on the trajectory of the margins in pharmacy. So, you'll recall that this year, in 2023, we made pretty significant investments as it relates to the acceleration of BioPlus and advanced home delivery, and that puts some pressure on our margins in 2023. That will not repeat itself in 2024.\\nWe did go live with BioPlus on January 1, as well as with respect to advanced on delivery. We're really excited about that, and it's moving in the right direction. And over time, we've built those products for scale. And as that business builds and progresses, we will continue to see margin improvement.\\nSo, that is what is delivering an improvement in margin in '24.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNext question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\\nScott Fidel -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could -- just on the commercial risk enrollment guidance, if you can break that down for us between group and individual? And then on the individual piece, I'm curious in terms of what you're thinking in terms of how much of that growth comes from the catchers mitt for Medicaid. And then how you're thinking about the acuity of those lives that are coming into the exchanges from Medicaid? We know that in Medicaid, that acuity is generally rising as the redeterminations continue.\\nSo, I'm curious, though, in terms of those lives that are transitioning into the exchanges, are you thinking about those as being sort of higher or lower or in line acuity with the legacy population in the exchange market? Thanks a lot.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, Scott. I think we've got about four or five in there. So, we'll try to hit the high points of your question. Let me ask Morgan and then Mark to comment on your question.\\nMorgan?\\nMorgan Kendrick -- President, Commercial Health Benefits Business\\nYes, Scott, thanks for the question. As we think about the ACA business, we've talked about it for a while now, we're quite bullish on that segment. And as we've remarked in other quarterly reports, we operate in all rating areas in our 14 geographies where we can. And certainly, we've seen an expansion in the actual market share and the market growth actually in these geographies.\\nIn fact, it's certainly a big driver is Medicaid redetermination. As we've indicated earlier on the call today, we've concluded about two-thirds of those. We expect that to continue in 2024. And also, as we've noted in the past, we've seen an elongated period of time from when someone is redetermined and when they actually join Medicare or come on an ACA product moving along.\\nThat said, quite pleased that our growth this year is outpacing our market growth. So, clearly, we're picking up our fair share and more, quite honestly, of the Medicaid redetermined members. So, at the end of the day, this will continue. We've had a very steadfast and steady approach around the right economics and the right network strategies to draw in these members.\\nIt's very important for the business to continue. And I'm going to turn that over to Mark to speak a little bit about the margins and the separation of the various pieces that you asked the questions on.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. If I think about Medicaid rates and acuity, the conversations with the states are ongoing. We'll continue to work with them and their consultants, really to ensure that all adjustments are reasonable and reflect the risk associated with ongoing redeterminations in 2024. Our outlook for 2024 does assume a normalization of Medicaid margins -- we already have line of sight into about 70% of Medicaid premiums for 2024.\\nAnd we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the underlying rates, especially understanding the acuity for leavers versus stayers.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. And thanks, Scott. And I think you also asked about the acuity in the individual exchange marketplace. So, I wanted to just put a fine point on that.\\nOur risk profile of the members we're picking up certainly in '23, obviously, early in '24, very much aligns with the expectation of what we've historically had. So, we feel it's actually rolling out to our expectations. So, thank you for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nBen Hendrix -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nThank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on the Carelon margin question. On Carelon Services, slightly down margins in the guidance. Just wanted to see if that -- the degree to which that is associated with new risk-based arrangements or membership or to the -- perhaps to the new behavioral benefits and kind of what are the prospects for that kind of ramping up beyond 2024? Thanks.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nThanks for the questions. First of all, we're very pleased with the operating performance of Carelon. You saw that play through in 2023. I think we committed to 25 to 50 basis points of improvement.\\nYou saw 70 basis points of improvement year over year. So, that -- it's performing really well. You answered the question already as it relates to 2024. Quite frankly, we are, as Gail talked about and as I talked about earlier, launching some very significant at-risk product offerings, both oncology, seriously mentally ill population, as well as others, and that comes with a lower margin in the earlier years, but that improves over time.\\nSo, that is precisely what was creating the pressure on the margin in '24.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. And just to sort of put a finer point on it, we do remain confident in our long-term guidance that we gave in mid to upper single-digit operating margin. So, as Pete said, we think the business we're bringing on is really good. We're committed to bringing in more risk business.\\nBut in the early years, that does have a little bit lower profile. But overall, we feel very good about the long term. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nJustin Lake -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nThanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of numbers here. First, you reported $200 million-plus of positive prior year development a quarter, materially more than I think the company has ever seen in Q4.\\nJust curious, given the MLR was generally in line, can you tell us whether there were any pressure areas that worked to offset the benefit of the PYD in the quarter? And then with the benefits repositioning of Medicare Advantage, which we've clearly done, do you expect to be within your 3% to 5% target margin here for Medicare Advantage in '24? Thanks.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nJustin, thank you very much for the question this morning. We are confident that our year-end reserves are prudent and have been set consistent with historical practice. In the quarter, you are correct that we saw positive prior-year development on a gross basis, and that was indeed favorable. It's worth pointing out here that that was largely offset through premium rebates and colors, as well as the reestablishment of reserves for the current year.\\nAn alternative way to think about this is that our full-year days in claims payable decreased just 0.2 days year over year. And that's noteworthy in the context of the fact that we have observed cycle times to have actually decreased more than three days, since the end of December 2022. And that should give you a feel for our comfort level around reserves. On your second question, just relative to the long-term target margin ranges, commercial is on track to achieve our long-term goals.\\nLet's say, Medicaid is normalizing but continues to perform well. And then Medicare Advantage for now is below our long-term target margin range.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nGary Taylor -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on enrollment. I kind of thought the story for '23 was that with the intentional commercial repricing, which has been pretty successful this year, you lost some commercial risk enrollment because of that. And I'm just trying to figure out on the million plus decline in risk enrollment for '24, how much of that is commercial risk versus the expected Medicaid redeterminations.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWe're all pleased with the performance of our commercial business in the fourth quarter and in 2023. We did make meaningful progress toward our margin recovery goals in the year. I'd say January renewals have gone well. We certainly experienced to-date higher retention than we did at the same period last year.\\nRepricing actions, as you would expect, do continue to impact membership growth, but this is expected. And so, we're really continuing to expect approximately flat membership growth overall in our group risk business this year, while continuing to improve margins in line with our stated goals.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. And just again, to put a fine point, most of the losses in risk membership is driven by both the Medicaid redeterminations and the adjustment in the footprints that we've shared with you in the past. So, that really is the key driver. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\\nDave Windley -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\nThanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to go to CarelonRx on the revenue growth side. High growth in '23. Low single digits, I think, you're expecting in '24, I suspect, the BioPlus acquisition inorganically would have contributed to some of that growth in '23, but I don't think it bridges the full change.\\nSo, maybe you could add some color around the slowdown in growth, the lower growth expectations for CarelonRx in '24? Thanks.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nYeah, thanks. Excuse me. Thanks, Dave, for the question. As it relates to 2023 and the growth of around 18.6% that did exceed our initial guidance -- and as you alluded to, that was driven primarily by the BioPlus acquisition and including BioPlus and our results to a lesser extent, drug mix and trends.\\nBut I would say, as it relates to 2024, I would say we have tremendous momentum in the business. And we're really excited about how our strategy is playing through. We've talked about assuming the strategic levers that really matter in our business. We've done that with Specialty Pharmacy and BioPlus.\\nWe've done that with advanced home delivery. You heard about the recent announcement of Paragon, an infusion which we're really excited about. And then there are several new product launches that are resonating in the marketplace that we've talked about previously, like insurer access as one of the examples. And this momentum is playing through in our sales in 2024.\\nWe are having a good season. Obviously, that activity occurred in 2023. Our retention remains strong. Our sweet spot does remain in that 3,000 to 10,000 range in terms of the business that we're attracting.\\nAnd as you know, there's a little more reticence in terms of the larger jumbo accounts moving. But I would say that a couple of notable wins there. We saw a couple of wins in the 20,000 to 50,000 range. So, we're really excited about the momentum in Carelon and what we're doing strategically and how that's playing through in the marketplace.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Pete. Our next question will be our last question.\\nOperator\\nFor our final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\\nGeorge Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nYeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in after Dave. I'm going to come back to MA margins one more time. And I'm going to ask you if you could expand a little bit if there is a way to disaggregate kind of the MA margin expansion thinking about your pricing initiatives versus utilization expectation versus mix and kind of the market exits that you guys have targeted.\\nJust trying to figure if you can kind of maybe rank order the contribution on margin expansion in MA from each of those four initiatives?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks very much for the question, George. We are not looking to necessarily provide individual margin guidance within the health benefit segment. Certainly, we feel comfortable with where we're guiding to in aggregate for 2024 and the 25 to 50 basis point range. And we think that the qualitative commentary that we provided in the call today should give you enough to get a feel for how the management team is thinking about this.\\nGiven this is my first earnings call, I just want to spend a minute on capital deployment before we close out here. And I just wanted to make the point that I expect to continue with Elevance Health's existing strategic policy around capital deployment, as I believe it really strikes the right balance between growth and the return of capital to our stockholders. And just as a reminder, we are going to target 50% of our free cash flow toward M&A or organic reinvestment and approximately 50% is a return of capital to our stockholders, either via the 30% for share repurchases or the 20% for dividends. And each year may differ, but over the years, we expect to allocate capital consistent with this framework.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark. And thank you to everyone who joined us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about our future, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year.\\nThank you again for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through February 23, 2024.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us to review Shockwave's results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023, which proved to be another banner one for the company. During the year, we launched C2 in Japan. We converted to direct sales forces in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Canada.\\nWe launched two new products, L6 for peripheral vessels and C2+ for the coronaries. We were granted DRG codes specific to coronary IVL in the inpatient hospital setting, which pay on average about $9,000 more than codes for PCIs without IVL. We acquired and integrated Neovasc and the Reducer product, which is the first device that addresses refractory angina, an often debilitating condition that impacts a large patient population that has no good treatment options, and we raised $750 million in a convertible debt offering. We achieved record revenue of $203 million in the fourth quarter, which was a 41% increase from a year ago, and a 9% sequential increase from the third quarter of 2023.\\nOur revenue for the full year of 2023 was $730.2 million, a 49% increase from 2022 revenue. We witnessed excellent performance in all areas of the business, with U.S. peripheral and coronary businesses growing 47% and 41%, respectively, and our international IVL business growing 75% compared to 2022. Really stellar performance.\\nThe team continues to execute at a high level, and we now have over 1,500 global employees. Our products are approved in 70 countries, and we are pleased that we now have EU MDR certification for M5+, S4 and C2+ catheters and our generator. The MDR process was a long journey and required a major effort by the team. Our U.S.\\ncoronary business continues to shine, and we have a couple of meaningful reimbursement tailwinds that will support continued adoption. The new hospital inpatient DRGs for coronary went into effect in the fourth quarter of last year and additionally, physicians are now being paid when they use coronary IVL thanks to the CPT code that became effective on January 1 of this year. As we have witnessed in the past, reimbursement takes time to influence customer behavior, but we anticipate that the combination of these new payments will have a positive impact on our U.S. coronary business and will help lower the economic friction that has historically been the biggest constraint on increased utilization of IVL.\\nWe anticipate that physicians will increasingly use C2+ whenever they feel it's clinically appropriate, versus feeling pressured to only use it selectively or after exhausting all other options. We believe an IVL-first strategy is optimal for patients and is now even better economically for customers. Also on the coronary topic, we are continuing the launch of C2+, which has 50% more pulses than its predecessor C2. Isaac will talk a bit more about this later in the call, but early reception from our customers has been very positive.\\nOn the U.S. peripheral side, the prior authorization issue appears to have stabilized as our customers are learning how to navigate Aetna's increased scrutiny on peripheral procedures, and we have not seen any other payers follow Aetna's practices. Meanwhile, multiple medical societies have come together to form a working group, and they have been applying pressure on Aetna in hopes of getting them to reconsider their policy. There also has been considerable attention paid to Medicare Advantage recently.\\nAt the federal level, CMS recently announced new rules, which will make it harder to pursue prolonged prior authorization practices. There also has been some predictive recent movement among commercial payers specific to Shockwave, as HUMANA, the second largest Medicare Advantage payer, issued a positive coverage decision for IVL for their Medicare Advantage plans effective January 1, 2024. Staying on the topic of U.S. peripheral reimbursement, we are pleased to see that CMS improved hospital reimbursement by assigning peripheral IVL to new MS-DRGs.\\nThese new DRGs increased inpatient hospital payment by $4,000 to $10,000 over previous levels. Most peripheral interventions are performed in an outpatient setting. However, a majority of the hospital-based below-the-knee procedures are for the more severe chronic limb-threatening ischemia or CLTI, which makes them more likely to be performed on an inpatient basis than other procedures. This reimbursement uplift nicely complements the upcoming advances in our below-the-knee product offering that starts later this year.\\nWhile on the topic of new products, we will be focusing back on peripheral in the second half of this year with two launches. First, we will introduce an upgraded version of L6, which will go from one pulse per second to two. We witnessed a very positive response from our customers when we made this same upgrade going from M5 to M5+. Shortly after the L6 rollout, we plan to launch the E8 peripheral catheter.\\nE8 has an eight-centimeter-long treatment zone, which is twice as long as our current S4 offering and is specifically designed to treat longer diffuse lesions that are common and below-the-knee cases. We look forward to seeing our customers' response to E8. We think they're going to love it. Rounding out our future BTK offering, we anticipate the approval of our JAVELIN peripheral catheter in the latter part of the year and look forward to starting the limited market release of that product prior to an expected full market release in early 2025.\\nThat makes three significant new peripheral launches within the next year. And finally, on the operations front. Our facility in Costa Rica has gone from first shovel in the ground in June of 2022 to a validated clean room and C2+ line in December of 2023. Amazing progress, frankly.\\nWe'll be hosting regulatory audits starting this month and anticipate shipping finished product into inventory in the third quarter of this year. 2023 was a great year for Shockwave, and we are even more excited about what lies ahead in 2024. We expect revenue between $910 million to $930 million for the full year of 2024, representing growth of 25% to 27% over 2023. Before I turn the call over to Isaac to provide more color on the commercial front, I want to take a minute to thank our outgoing CFO, Dan Puckett, for the tremendous job he has done in his eight years at Shockwave.\\nDuring his time here, he was instrumental in our growth from a small pre-revenue private company to a public company with over $700 million in revenue. Dan is not only a fantastic CFO, but he is a joy to work with. He's been the biggest cheerleader for all of us, always supportive and inspiring to everyone around him and he will be sorely missed. We wish Dan well in his retirement and are pleased to introduce our new CFO, Renee Gaeta, who is jumping right in today, and will present the financials a bit later in the call.\\nAnd if he gets anything wrong, it's all Dan's fault. With that, I'll turn the call over to Isaac.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nThank you, Doug. Our record results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023 reflect outstanding contributions from our businesses and teams around the globe. Q4 2023 was strong for our U.S. coronary business.\\nRevenue grew 40% compared to Q4 of 2022, 11% sequentially from Q3 of 2023 and 15% sequentially on an average daily sales basis. The C2+ launch is proceeding well. We launched over 1,000 accounts and the product has been very well received. What is particularly appreciated is the utility of more pulses in longer diffuse lesions, eccentric lesions, and calcified nodules.\\nWe expect continued momentum in the coronary business as our sales team focuses on the C2+ launch and on communicating both the favorable reimbursement changes and additional physician fees for using coronary IVL. Revenue from our U.S. peripheral business in Q4 2023 was up 19% from a year ago, flat sequentially compared to Q3 and up 3% sequentially on an average daily sales basis. As Doug mentioned, we are seeing a stabilization of the prior authorization dynamic as providers are getting better at navigating the additional steps required for some patients.\\nWe continue to expect modest growth in the U.S. peripheral business in the first half of 2024 as we maintained a strong focus on the U.S. coronary business. We did anticipate accelerated U.S.\\nperipheral growth in the second half of 2024 with the L6 and E8 product launches. Turning to our international business. We had another record quarter of IVL sales as revenue was up 67% from a year ago, and 14% sequentially compared to Q3. We are now direct in all five major European markets: Germany, the U.K., Spain, Italy, and France.\\nSales in Germany doubled during 2023 due to the improved coronary reimbursement. We are starting to see increased usage in some of the smaller German accounts, which can now afford IVL. Germany is the largest market in Europe, and we think there is tremendous upside for coronary penetration from the current level of just over 2%. We had our first full quarter of direct sales in Italy and are very pleased with the execution by that team.\\nIt feels good to see such strong and seamless execution from the direct selling teams in Europe. We continue to drive penetration with the focus of the Shockwave sales team and the support of our marketing and physician education programs. In Japan, we completed our first year of coronary sales. We exceeded our goals for the number of accounts launched, the penetration in the launched accounts, and revenue.\\nWe have initiated efforts to develop clinical data that will support using IVL in conjunction with atherectomy and drug-coated balloons. We are working closely with CVIT, the interventional cardiology society in Japan, to ensure that IVL is available and appropriately used throughout Japan. In China, we are still experiencing the impact of the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which is slowing IVL adoption at new centers. On the positive side, adoption within centers that had IVL on the pricing list before the anti-corruption campaign started is growing nicely.\\nThat said, we expect very little revenue from China in the first half of 2024. Finally, the European Reducer team posted a very nice quarter. The teams in Germany and France are being rebuilt, and along with the established U.K. team, continue to generate revenue while testing different market development strategies and sales models.\\nWe are very pleased with the integration of Neovasc and are starting 2024 with strong teams in place to both accelerate enrollment in the COSIRA-II trial and build the international Reducer business. With that, I will turn the call to Renee to review the financials.\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Isaac, and good afternoon, everyone. I am thrilled to have joined the Shockwave team and look forward to working with all of you. Shockwave Medical's revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, was $203 million. a 41% increase from $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nU.S. revenue was $158.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 34% from $118.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Coronary products contributed $115.2 million to U.S. revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 40% from $82.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nU.S. revenue from our peripheral products was $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 19% from $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The growth in U.S. revenue during the quarter was driven primarily by increased utilization at existing accounts, supported by our continued sales force expansion.\\nInternational revenue was $44.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a 74% increase from $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Coronary products contributed $37.7 million to international revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an 83% increase from $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. International revenue from our peripheral products was $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 19% from $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Reducer product contributed $1.8 million to international revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nThe increase in international revenue over the prior year period was driven by a continued geographic expansion, particularly in Japan, the increased productivity of our direct selling teams in Europe and the momentum from our C2+ launch. Looking at product lines, our peripheral products, Shockwave M5, Shockwave M5+, Shockwave S4 and Shockwave L6, accounted for $48.1 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $40.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 19% increase. Our coronary products, Shockwave C2 and Shockwave C2+, accounted for $152.9 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $102.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a 49% increase. Revenue from our Reducer product accounted for $1.8 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $177.7 million compared to $126.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 88% for the fourth quarter of 2023, consistent with gross margin of 88% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $134.4 million, a 60% increase from $84.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $67.2 million compared to $43.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nThe increase was primarily driven by sales force expansion. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $42.3 million compared to $23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by head count growth, higher clinical-related expenses, including Reducer, and the facility expansion to support R&D. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $24.9 million compared to $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nThe increase was primarily driven by higher head count to support the growth of the business. Operating margin was 21% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $44.3 million compared to net income of $140.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we released a valuation allowance, which resulted in a tax benefit of $99 million in that quarter.\\nBasic net income per share for the period was $1.20. Diluted net income per share for the period was $1.16. Adjusted EBITDA was $68.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 20% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $56.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, I'd like to briefly recap some highlights from our full year 2023 results.\\nTotal revenue for the full year 2023 was $730.2 million, an increase of 49% compared to full year 2022 revenue of $489.7 million. U.S. revenue for the full year 2023 was $581.5 million, representing a 43% increase over 2022 revenue of $407.4 million. International revenue was $148.7 million for the full year of 2023 compared to $82.3 million in 2022, representing an 81% increase.\\nGross margin for the full year 2023 was 87%, consistent with 87% for the full year 2022. Total operating expenses were $475.7 million in 2023, an increase of 58% compared to operating expenses of $300.6 million in 2022. Operating margin was 22% for the full year 2023. Total net income for the full year 2023 was $147.3 million compared to $216 million for the full year 2022.\\nNet income in 2022 included the $99 million tax benefit from the aforementioned release of our valuation allowance. Basic net income per share was $4.01 for the full year 2023. Diluted net income per share was $3.85 for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $242.7 million for the full year 2023, a 40% increase from adjusted EBITDA of $173.9 million for the full year 2022.\\nLooking forward to 2024, we expect to continue to make significant investments to support and sustain our growth and anticipate full year 2024 operating margin expansion of up to 100 basis points from the full year of 2023. Similar to the pattern we saw in 2023, we do expect a step-down in Q1 operating margin from the prior Q4, reflecting compensation and benefits costs, which reset at the beginning of the year as well as the timing and increased costs related to our global sales meeting held in March. We ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $990.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for closing comments.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Renee, and thank you all for joining us today. 2023 was another great year at Shockwave. The team continues to execute at the highest level as we achieve our mission to help treat underserved patient populations around the globe with our innovative solutions, and we're excited to continue this work in 2024. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Good afternoon. Nice quarter, and congrats on a fantastic year and welcome, Renee, on the new role. I wanted to start on the guidance construction, the top line, $910 million to $930 million.\\nMaybe just talk about what's embedded for some of the different pieces of the business, coronary versus peripheral versus Reducer? And if I heard correctly, you said modest U.S. peripheral growth in the first half of '24, then accelerate in the back half with new product launches. Hoping you could flesh that out some. I'm assuming that's assuming some continued headwinds from Aetna, but wanted to, I guess, kind of understand what's baked into the guide for Aetna prior auths, as well as China anti-corruption.\\nAny potential impact from the step-down in outpatient reimbursement on the coronary side in the back half of the year? I'm sorry for the long-winded question.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. And we'll probably tag team on this. We are anticipating modest growth on peripheral particularly in the first couple of quarters while we concentrate on coronary. And then as we start launching L6 and E8 and turn our focus back to peripheral, we'll start seeing a step up in peripheral growth.\\nThe year will be another really strong year we anticipate for U.S. coronary contribution as a percent of the business. We anticipate U.S. coronary will be actually a larger percent of the total business than it was end of -- throughout the 2023.\\nWe obviously had a very strong international performance last year. We anticipate another strong year, although we have the China deficit. So, ex China, international is going to do very well, but we'll be losing over $10 million in -- somewhere between $10 million and $20 million in revenue that we would have -- that we had last year in China that we're not going to get this year. So, we're anticipating sort of very low single-digit revenue out of China.\\nSo, ex China, another strong contribution year from the international business. And Isaac, I don't know if you --\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nLast point, Adam, you asked about was on the outpatient -- for coronary U.S. in the second half, the outpatient payment? We don't anticipate. I mean, we're aware of the situation, obviously. We still expect baseline is that the TPT will -- is set to expire July 1, and it will expire July 1.\\nWe still anticipate the up leveling to 5194 will occur Jan 1 of 2025, but what we've seen typically with reimbursement in the U.S. is it takes time to move behavior and change behavior patterns and what -- so we've not been on this kind of good, good run in coronary, and we have a really strong coronary business and momentum right now, with the inpatient reimbursement continue to be a tailwind, the physician fee continue to be a tailwind, the C2+ launch is a tailwind, and we just don't anticipate that having the TPT expire in the middle of the year will be much of a headwind, TBD, but that's kind of what we've seen in our -- that's what we've baked into our guidance.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nYeah. That's good color, guys. Thank you for that. And for the follow-up, we'll stick with the guidance topic and switch over to margins.\\nIf I heard correctly, you're expecting up to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion for full year '24 over '23 levels. That's a little bit below kind of where the street is pre call. Maybe I would just love to hear a little bit more about kind of what's embedded in that assumption. Should we be orienting models to kind of 50 basis points kind of the midpoint of that range? Or should we start at 100 basis points kind of coming out of the Q4 call here? And yes, I just would love to hear a little bit more about the philosophy on the leverage piece.\\nThanks so much.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So, we -- as usual, we're going to continue investing in aggressively in our pipeline, both on the sort of hardcore product development side, and increasingly, the clinical trial expenses, which whether it's the trial for Reducer, the COSIRA-II study or the various trials such as DUO that we're running now or EMPOWER. We initiated multiple trials next year and they're becoming more expensive -- last year. And this year, we'll spend even more on those trials.\\nSo, big step-up in clinical spend. We'll continue to augment our global sales footprint, but the U.S. team will not be growing at the same rate that it has historically. We've -- we're not done building out that team, but the rate of change will be lower.\\nSo, the -- so you'll probably see a little leverage on sales, sort of not incremental leverage on R&D. We shouldn't see much deleveraging on R&D, but that will probably be static relative to the top line. We're still spending money right now. We're still having to expense Costa Rica, and that does not convert into inventory until later in the year.\\nAnd so, we're still having to absorb Costa Rica costs, which are not insignificant.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nI got it. And just one clarification, Doug. No change to the 500 basis points operating margin expansion over '23 levels that you outlined at the Innovation Day last year. I just wanted to confirm that's still the case.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. We've been -- we've articulated previously that it's going to be '25, '26. We're pleased that -- if this plan delivers as expected, we're very pleased with up to 100-basis-point improvement. If you want to model 50, I'm perfectly OK with that.\\nAnd we'll obviously try to do better, but we're targeting top-line growth, as our objective, not -- we think the margin improvement is really an output of the business versus the specific objective of the business.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nThanks for the color.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nHey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of things here. You gave us a little granularity on what you're seeing from Aetna.\\nAnd just what do you think in terms of when this comes back? Is this just like a three-, six-, nine-month delay? Or does this take patients out of the funnel? Or does it come back at some point in time? How should we think about just Aetna going forward?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I'm going to answer this and bring in Rob Fletcher as well to add color. What's unknowable for us is, is a patient -- is an Aetna Shockwave patient that got treated today somebody who would have been treated four months ago, two months ago, one month ago? Don't know. It's impossible for us to have that level of granularity.\\nAnd maybe Rob can talk a bit more about sort of what he's seeing more broadly on -- from our team and from societies on this prior auth.\\nRob Fletcher -- Senior Vice President, Marketing and Market Access\\nYeah, that's right, Bill. I think what typically happens after a change in practice from one of the payers that are out there is what you see is at the provider level, at the hospital level, there's often a reaction to that. They have to do more documentation, or they have to take additional measures or steps or allow for more time to go through a prior authorization process. So, typically, what we see is over time after some initial sort of temporal disruption, people figure out how to start working within this and then they plan for it.\\nAnd then it kind of becomes -- back to a steady state. It's kind of a new normal, but you wind up with more of a steady state type of effect. And I think that's what we're seeing and hearing now from customers is that that has really sort of stabilized. People have figured out how to work within that.\\nMeanwhile, we do see action being taken from the medical societies, for example, who did, over the course of this period, come together. Jointly, there was multiple medical societies, and did issue an additional letter to Aetna that covered a bunch of different things, including this prior authorization practice. So, you are starting to see some pushback, and I expect that Aetna will take that under consideration under many other things. But for the time being, I think it's -- I'd describe it as what appears to be more a stable situation at a new normal.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then as a follow-up, I don't want to leave Renee out on our first conference call. Welcome, Renee. Is -- your other income was significant in the quarter, well above.\\nCan you kind of call out any one-times there for us?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWouldn't necessarily be one-time, but certainly, interest income is within that number and then, of course, our interest expense out on the convertible debt. So, that number is going to be nice, given interest rates currently. And thank you for the question.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nSo, $15.3 million, is that something we should model in going forward?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\n$15.3 million might be a little high. There's probably some FX in there. Yeah. So, it's slightly high, but there's -- just because of the FX for the period, but it is largely interest income.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nAmazing. Thank you. Maybe just to hop off on that point. The amount of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, you're approaching $1 billion, so it's nearly as much as is in my checking account.\\nAnd so, I got to ask like what do you like -- updated thoughts? I know there was like a willingness to be sort of strategically footed around M&A., so obviously, it's like nearly an eighth of your market cap. How are you thinking about capital allocation?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd if you want to Venmo me, Patrick, I'm receptive. I'll give you my numbers. So, yes, we continue to be very receptive to smart strategic external opportunities. Maybe emphasis on smart or trying to be smart, at least.\\nWe raised the convert with the -- recognizing that there was a window where valuations for private companies were down, and they still are. It's very hard to raise money for small companies. And valuations have said private companies were -- and willingness of boards sort of had changed over a 12-, 24-month period. And we didn't -- at middle of last year, we did not have the cash wherewithal to make offers on some -- on properties that we might be interested or thought we might be interested in, and we realized that the convert structure and terms were just so attractive that having a 1% coupon in a period where we can -- we're netting a nice interest income relative to our interest expense right now.\\nAnd we didn't raise the money so that we could invest the money, we raised the money so that we could be opportunistic if something came along. That said, the worst thing you could do is just because you have cash, run out and buy something that is not smart to buy. And so, if at the end of the day, we don't see anything that we think is going to be accretive to our growth and accretive to our shareholder value, then we'll sit on the cash until we find something that is worth investing in. That gives us tremendous amount of strategic flexibility that we're -- we feel really fortunate to have for a company at our stage, to be growing at our rate, to be profitable and have this much cash on the books is really -- we recognize the unique position we're in.\\nBut we don't feel obligated to run out and spend that money on something because then we would be more likely to do something that wasn't smart.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nTotally. And maybe as a quick follow-up, the -- slightly more bigger picture, and I know we don't talk about OUS that much, but when do you think you're going to get to a point of a body of clinical evidence that can kind of help unlock some of the penetration in some of the other markets? Obviously, Germany went your way recently, and I know in the U.K., nice sort of reformulated that language around peripheral. But just kind of -- is there like a critical mass of evidence that you feel is needed to unlock the markets? Or is it something else?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nI'll take a shot at that. I think in many of the markets, it's unlikely that at least with our coronary and our peripheral IVL that will amass enough evidence that those systems, kind of the National Health Systems will increase or give extra payment for IVL. I think it's -- those are generally going to need to be large, randomized studies, showing cost effectiveness compared to other products. And we just don't see those studies being necessary, really, one, but also, we're not -- we talked about this a lot internally.\\nWe don't know what to randomize against. Because we don't -- randomizing against the balloon, we don't think is an appropriate study, randomizing against atherectomy, we don't think it's an appropriate study. There are different tools for different clinical situations. So, we're working on it.\\nWe have -- Japan, we're in a good spot. Obviously, Germany, we're in a good spot. Hopefully continue to get better. Our JV is working on regional reimbursement in China, and we'll make progress there.\\nBut I think generally, it's going to be -- IVL is going to be paid for out of kind of hospital funds and the budgets they have to treat to treat patients without any incremental payment for IVL.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWhat will be interesting to see is with COSIRA-II, assuming success in that study, that's exactly the kind of study that the sham-controlled randomized study, again, assuming it works, it will be undeniable that that product does what it was designed to do and actually increases the chances that Reducer could be -- could get reimbursement in some of those systems. And it's a stand-alone procedure versus IVL that drops into existing procedures that are already paid for, so it's harder outside of certain discrete markets like Germany and Japan and the U.S., it's harder to get an incremental payment in those systems because they're kind of not structured to pay more per device, whereas a small subset of countries do pay differentially based on the way they code for different device utilization.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nTotally get it. Thanks so much for taking the questions.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYou're welcome.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHey, thanks for taking the question, and welcome, Renee. Doug, maybe a little bit more color on what modest peripheral growth means. Is that still in the 10% to 15% range? Or is it more low single digits? And is that modest growth every quarter of the year?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nMore modest early. So, low -- we think probably low singles for the first half of the year, stepping up to probably low doubles to teens in the back half of the year.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nOK. Helpful. And then in Q1 -- or sorry, just like in January and February so far, anything to call out on trends in coronary and peripheral? And I'm curious if the total revenue for Q1's still picking up sequentially a little bit.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, on the latter, up a bit sequentially. It was a strong fourth quarter, obviously. We were pleased with the fourth quarter. We're relieved -- not surprised but encouraged that the contagion fear was not realized.\\nWe weren't afraid of contagion from Aetna, but I know a lot of folks who are probably listening to this call we were a little worried that it was going to be multiple payers were going to do what Aetna was doing, and we certainly aren't seeing that. I'd say procedure volumes appear sound. We're not -- we're pleased with what we're hearing from the field.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nOK, great. Thanks a lot for the questions.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYep.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Starting, Doug, in the U.S., U.S. coronary accelerated in Q4.\\nHow much do you think the new DRGs are helping already? And on peripheral, sales were flattish sequentially. Aetna is only 10% to 12% of covered lives, I believe. U.S. peripheral was a growth driver for you.\\nSo, help us understand how Aetna has had so much of an impact? And I had one follow-up.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Aetna was the phenomenon that was the real change that we noted after the sort of mid -- it really took place in September, so end of Q3. carried through into Q4. And when we first -- when we did our call last year, I don't know that we described the underlying sort of slowness of procedures that we were seeing in the third quarter into the fourth quarter for peripheral.\\nSo, it would have been -- we would have been a little soft on peripheral, and then you compounded that with Aetna. I'd say, on balance, peripheral procedures appear to be somewhat less soft, but it's -- so I think we feel more bullish about growth, particularly as we turn focus back to peripheral. Right now, we're -- for good reason, with two reimbursement changes, a new product launch, we really want to maximize on our coronary opportunity. And then when we have three product launches in a row in peripheral we'll be spending a lot of time on peripheral.\\nSo, we're anticipating peripheral will contribute much more nicely to growth end of '24 into '25, and high hopes for JAVELIN to be a major contributor to that end as well. So, we're -- you're not wrong. Aetna is a 10% to 20% player on the -- in the matrix of all the private payers. So, it wasn't just an Aetna phenomenon, but Aetna, clearly, was a meaningful -- had a meaningful impact, but it wasn't the entirety of the impact on the peripheral volume in the back end of last year.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nAnd Doug, sorry, the first part of the question was the acceleration in U.S. coronary. Was this -- the strength in the quarter came from U.S. coronary.\\nHave you started to see an impact from the new DRGs already? And I'll ask my follow-up, Doug. There's a late breaker at ACC on Neovasc this ORBITA-COSMIC. How is it different from COSIRA-II? And is there any read-through from that trial to what we might see in COSIRA-II? Thank you.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's really hard to -- well, generally, as we say consistently on reimbursement because it's what we've observed, it's a dimmer switch not an on and off switch, so it has an effect gradually over time. And we launched C2+ and we got the uplift simultaneously. It certainly doesn't -- it did not hurt at all. It will always be impossible to disaggregate new product launch and reimbursement that happened simultaneously, and it's now going to be even harder because now we've got the CPT goods.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nYeah. I'll just pile on to that, Larry. What we talked about in the past, what the inpatient -- I think especially the inpatient uplift in the DRG, what it does ultimately is as the hospitals see the income coming in, it helps the cath lab budget get relaxed. And so, the cath lab then puts less pressure on physicians to moderate their use.\\nThey can -- physicians then feel like they use IVL when it's appropriate and they're not getting pushback from cath lab administrators. And that takes time. I was at an account earlier this week in Santa Cruz, and that was the input from them. They just don't -- they're not getting push back from the administration anymore.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd on ORBITA-COSMIC, we certainly are delighted to see multiple data sets for Reducer at ACC. That's encouraging. We don't know the results from that study. It's small, 50-ish patients, so it's not going to be powered to make any conclusions about it.\\nThey use MRI as an endpoint, so really unclear if that's a -- I see that as a feasibility of that tool versus something that's going to be just positive about the Reducer. I won't be surprised if you see that patients' symptoms are better because that's what we see consistently in the various studies that have been done on Reducer and what we see anecdotally from all the users in Europe. Whether you really learn anything, that is a read-through to COSIRA-II because we don't use MRI as an endpoint in COSIRA-II, so I don't know that that's going to really be informative on potential outcome of the COSIRA-II study. If the patients feel better in the treatment arm, that bodes well for COSIRA-II, I guess, could be the one takeaway.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask on the outpatient coronary reimbursement topic with an eye toward the map to 5194. Kind of two-parter.\\nThe event path from here, and then a question on coding. So, is this event path simply we wake up in July, we see the proposal and we see what we see? Or do you have an opportunity to engage with CMS here through this spring that might give you a better feel for how they're looking at this? And the second piece is on coding. I think we're operating under the assumption that this winds up getting solved with the complexity adjustment using the new CPT code that was in effect Jan 1, '24. Is that correct? Or is there potentially another to-be-determined coating solution here?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. It would be a waste if I try to answer this one. Rob's sitting right next to me, so I'll let Rob take this one.\\nRob Fletcher -- Senior Vice President, Marketing and Market Access\\nYeah. I think the -- so as part of normal course of business, we do get on CMS' calendar as they start to make -- they get into their rule-making cycle. And so, certainly, we have met with CMS, again, about this issue and the issue of the transitional pass-through and so on and so forth. So, I think your first question was what's the normal course of business and the sort of things that happen.\\nAnd the first thing that happens is that you sort of talk with CMS prior to them making the rule, drafting the rule, about your issue at hand. And so, that's happened. I think the things that we see from here, yes, I would mainly point the next sort of public available information is likely going to be the proposed rule, which happens in early July. So, we won't sort of see or hear much in the public domain between now and then.\\nSo, hopefully, Mike, that got that part of the question. I think your second part of the question, or your second question, was just around the mechanism that would proceed here. And I think you've identified it correctly that here, what we're talking about as a complexity adjustment that's based on an add-on code, a procedure add-on code, and that's the normal vehicle by which if you have an add-on code in structure, that's how you get increased payment, is then you then sort of qualify -- certain combinations of code qualify for complexity adjustment, and that's exactly sort of what we're looking at here. And as for on this call and others, this is where we have a very large volume of data associated with that.\\nWe have sort of strong confidence in these combinations of codes and then qualifying for complexity adjustment.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nThat was a great, Rob, on both fronts. And the brief follow-up is maybe back to Doug. I think, Doug, on several instances, you've suggested maybe 95% confidence in the outcome here of kind of achieving 5194 in 2025 and beyond. Is 95% still how you feel about this?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nI do not feel less confident. I wish CMS, when Rob met with them, said, you're right, we're going to do it. But they don't say those things. They just look blankly at Rob.\\nAnd every time we meet, and usually, we get a good outcome. And this time, I think the facts are pretty clearly pointing in the direction of moving to 5194.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nHelpful. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions, and welcome, Renee. You called out 2% penetration in Germany. Can you just give us a sense of where you are in terms of penetration within key accounts? And what have you seen in terms of how utilization has scaled early on, and what procedure volumes look like in some of the top accounts?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. We have -- I think even in the top accounts in Germany, the penetration is still relatively low. What happens in Germany when there isn't sufficient payment to cover the cost of a product, there's a very tight linkage between the hospital administration and the physician's behavior in Germany, tighter than I think anywhere else except Japan. So, what happens is the physicians will use the product until the administration tells them to stop and then they stop.\\nSo, you'd get the cyclical -- an account using the product, and then it would just turn off in September. Or they'd use the product and then the administration will come back the next year and say, \\\"Hey, you used 50, you only get 25 this year.\\\" And so, the product utilization will get curtailed. And then at smaller accounts, it would essentially be zero because they just didn't have enough money within the hospital system to cover these extra costs and the administration would clamp down. So, we really have a lot of headroom in Germany, not just gaining adoption in smaller accounts, which is kind of a zero base in those accounts but then really driving appropriate use and adoption at the larger accounts where it was being curtailed by the administration.\\nDoes that answer your question?\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nYeah, it's perfect. I mean, just one separate follow-up. It looks like on COSIRA-II, the CT.gov is giving you a primary completion date of June 2024, but I just wanted to double check on how we should think about the timing there and when we could see those results.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, we need to update that.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nI don't think we've touched that since the acquisition, so that was not a realistic timeline ever.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. That was the prior company's timeline. Yes. Right now, if you recall, we're forecasting approval in '27.\\nYou got to back up from there for submission and review of a PMA, and then that puts your enrollment completion somewhere second half of '25 is a much more realistic timeline. And the team is doing a really exceptional job of getting sites up. There was a paucity of sites that had been started, and many of those sites weren't really probably the right sites to choose to get rapid enrollment. So, our team, once they took over, have gotten the trial on the rails, but it's a sham-controlled trial with a really rigorous enrollment criteria, inclusion criteria, which is why every time we show clinicians the trial design, they universally say if, and we would say when, when that study is successful, it's -- it will be irrefutable that that device works.\\nSo, rigorous trial makes it hard to enroll. A rigorous trial also results in much more valuable data for market creation and -- inclusive of reimbursement.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nThat's super helpful. Thanks very much.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nYeah, thanks. Just a couple on the new peripheral products, so E8 and JAVELIN. I can't remember if you had said anything about the pricing on those products at the Investor Day you did in the fall, but can you give us any sense there on where those things would be priced? And then with JAVELIN, I mean, am I thinking about it the right way that that's something that could drive more revenue per procedure, because they would likely use that to kind of cross a lesion and then you follow that up with one of the regular catheter -- or sorry, balloons?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nIf we said anything about price, it would have been something along the lines of we will determine the price when we get closer to launching the product, and that would still be what I would say now. Thus far, we try to make sure that we deliver really clinically meaningful new devices to our customers and price them in a way that we think is -- enables the customers to have a good financial outcome and for us to reflect the value of the technology. In terms of JAVELIN, there likely will be some cases where you use JAVELIN plus, JAVELIN plus E8, JAVELIN plus M5+, but we -- what we've witnessed thus far is that the power of the lithotripsy shock waves is not just cracking in a sort of forward effect to get you through the difficult to cross lesions, but it also has a radial effect, which enables you to then follow JAVELIN with standard balloon angioplasty. And so, our expectation is that the vast majority of cases will be JAVELIN plus POBA versus JAVELIN plus another IVL product.\\nAt some juncture, you start to get yourself in a challenging situation with your customers if you load too many IVL products into a single procedure. It just becomes less economically attractive for them. So, we're -- our expectation is that, for the most part, JAVELIN is going to be a JAVELIN plus other, JAVELIN plus balloon.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nOK. That makes sense. And then just as far as Costa Rica goes, I understand that there's some kind of start-up costs and whatnot in the near term, but is that something that you expect to have a material benefit to your gross margins over time?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have chosen to date to manufacture in one of the highest cost places in America, in Santa Clara. So, we do expect that our cost of goods will come down in Costa Rica. So, we've not forecast how many points will pick up out of Costa Rica, but cost of doing business there in every respect is going to be lower than -- other than materials cost, is going to be lower in every respect than what we have right now in Santa Clara.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nYeah. Just important to remember, though, that for 2024, the product we sell will be manufactured in Santa Clara, so we won't see any benefit to gross margin in 2024.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. We'll put product into inventory this year, but it won't hit customers until '25.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nYeah, I understand. So, there'll definitely be a benefit yet to be quantified, I guess, for '25 and beyond.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nDo you agree?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nCorrect. Yeah. I would certainly expect gross margins to be steady for this year. And then in the long run, we will see an improvement given the structure set up.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nOK, great. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First, on Japan, I'm wondering if you can just sort of give us any sort of metrics on where you are in that launch in terms of what percentage of the 1,200 or so cath labs there that you're in now at this stage of the launch?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. So, the -- again, very, very good year for the team in Japan. It's a relatively small team, and they were incredibly productive in 2023. Based on the guidelines that we worked with, that Shockwave worked with CVIT, the cardiovascular society in Japan, to establish, we are currently limited to hospitals that do a certain number of atherectomy procedures.\\nSo, those tend to be larger hospitals, obviously, with surgical backup. There's also some limitations on, because of the way the trial data we have, we don't have trial data of Shockwave followed by de novo DCB, and de novo DCB is approved in Japan. We don't have trial data of Shockwave after atherectomy, Rota-Shock, for instance. So, part of the work we're doing, it started last year, and we'll be going on in earnest this year and the following years, is to create clinical data to support the use of Shockwave with de novo DCB, to support the use of Rota-Shock, Shockwave with atherectomy.\\nAnd then as we gather more and more data, work with CVIT to show that the product can be safely used in smaller centers, in centers without surgical backup. And as you'll recall, we have that kind of stamp of approval in the U.S. from SCAI already. So, there is -- there's basically a certain number of centers that we have agreed with CVIT that we cannot access until we generate more data, and we're generating those data now.\\nSo, with the centers that we really can access, which account for probably 75% of the PCI in Japan, we're over 50% launched. Or sorry, we've launched over 50% of those centers, and we'll launch the remaining ones in 2024.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And what about the peripheral IVL side in Japan? What's the latest timeline there?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nWe haven't disclosed the timeline yet. We're working right now with the PMDA to establish the regulatory path, and then once that's done kind of first half of this year, we hope to have the path established, then we'll start lining out the timing and the -- or the steps and the timing to get there. And at some point, we'll tell you what that is.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And then one more international question on India. Obviously, a massive PCI market. Can you just remind us where you are there at this stage and how you're thinking about that opportunity over the next few years?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. We have a distributor in India. We established the distributor in 2020. We launched coincident with coronavirus in February 2020, so the -- as that country has kind of gone through some ups and downs like the rest of the world, we've gotten a good footprint in India through a distributor.\\nWe've generated really nice post-market data in India, post-market registry over 1,000 patients, all comers, core lab adjudicated. Those were presented at -- those data were presented at TCT last fall, and we continue to have really nice momentum, particularly on coronary in India.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And then just one very quick pipeline question. Have you guys started human cases with the aortic lithotripsy product yet?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have not. No.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nAny estimated timeline on that?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThis year.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nThis year. OK, perfect. OK. Thank you very much.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYep.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy. Please proceed with your question.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end to the year.\\nDoug, I was going to ask about C2+. How are you seeing that being adopted? I know it's early days. You said feedback has been good, but are you seeing it motivate more physicians to pick up IVL and do vessel prep in their patients? Or is it right now more about existing users, treating more patients, and accessing those tougher to treat patients?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I'd say it's more adoption existing users versus new users. And that's -- and more adoption is going to be the -- with all of the different tailwinds we have, reimbursement and technology tailwinds followed by another technology upgrade next year, it's really finding ways to help people who use -- shift from 4% to 10% and from 10% to 20%, helping give them a good reason to use Shockwave more than they already do. Those who don't use the device yet are in the minority and less of a -- sort of much less opportunity for us to drive growth with, because they're probably also pretty low-volume operators.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nOK. And that was kind of my -- one of my follow-up questions. You already touched on it, on existing users who both do IVL, and all of the patients previously know that there is a large number of patients that have severe disease and treating all of them, so they aren't picking a party to use. Why are they --\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nSo, your phone made it tricky to interpret your question, but I'm going to -- I'll restate your question as best I can, and you tell me if I'm wrong. So, what is the impediment to increase use of IVL or physicians?\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nSorry about that.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo, that's OK. It just makes it a little more challenging. So, the biggest reason historically has been, a, is the economic concern. We have a premium device that we priced at a level that we thought both reflected the value and would ultimately lead to a strong reimbursement position that would be beneficial to the hospital.\\nThankfully, the work Rob and team did was successful. We were successful in securing our own DRGs, which were shocking, on the coronary side, CPT code, and we think ultimately will also yield sort of landing in the highest APC level for coronaries. But the initial reaction to the price was, oh, this is a high-priced device, and there was a lot of anxiety with TPT. That's a little unusual in terms of a reimbursement mechanism, and so there's always been a perception among physicians that we're not really reimbursed even though we have been.\\nSo, there's always been a reluctance in many physicians' hands and minds to -- like I'll only use Shockwave when I absolutely have to because it's an expensive device. So, now that the first two of the three building blocks for eliminating that economic anxiety with the DRGs and CPT code are in place, we think this year will be the first year where a lot of that economic anxiety is ameliorated. The second, another reason why they have been reluctant historically is I've got this long diffuse lesion. You're going to -- I'm going to have to pull two catheters to treat it.\\nMaybe I'll just use atherectomy instead of Shockwave. C2+ addresses that long diffuse reluctance. It also helps diffuse the sort of misperception that Shockwave is less effective on eccentric or nodular calcium. So, now, we give you more power, you can treat those eccentric lesions with one catheter.\\nSo, those are really two of the big headwinds we had faced, the biggest being the economics. And then ultimately, the -- I think the last -- one of the sort of next hurdles that we'll knock down is the our device is very deliverable, but it's not as deliverable as physicians would like. So, there are times when they choose not to pull it because it's bulkier than a regular angioplasty balloon. So, I'll just use something else.\\nThat's a 2025 fix that we'll have with Arrow. So, we've got -- each year, we'll be knocking down the remaining -- some of the remaining pressure points that have capped utilization, and we think we'll just keep uncapping utilization each year.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nThank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThere are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to Doug Godshall for closing remarks.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks so much, and thanks, everybody, for your time and attention. Looking forward to another great year in 2024 and delighted to have Renee on board. Look forward to chatting with you all as the year progresses.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the DexCom fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call.

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin. \\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2023 was an incredible year for DexCom, and I'd like to start by reviewing some of our key accomplishments. Total revenue grew by 24% on an organic basis, driven by another year of record customer starts. This translates into more than $700 million of organic revenue growth compared to last year, as we built strong commercial momentum through recent coverage expansion and the performance of DexCom's CGM systems.\\nIn 2023, we added over 600,000 DexCom users to our base and ended the year with approximately 2.3 million customers globally. Importantly, we delivered this level of growth again while enhancing scale and efficiency of our operations. A key milestone here was the opening of our Malaysia manufacturing facility around midyear. Production at this site is ramping quickly, and the team is already delivering yields on par with our more established U.S.\\nfacilities. This facility will help support our growth and cost ambitions for years to come. As a measure of our success for 2023, we not only generated $1 billion in Q4 revenue, we also delivered $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the year and generated record levels of free cash flow, which is up nearly 70% compared to 2022. By establishing a disciplined cost culture that focuses years in advance, we are striking the right balance of margin progression, while still investing strategically in pathways to support our significant growth opportunities.\\nFrom a strategic perspective, 2023 will go down as one of the most transformational years in our company's history. We launched G7 and Dexcom ONE into multiple new markets significantly expanding our global access and advancing key technical and clinical work that will provide the foundation for the future of DexCom. This started with the rollout of G7 in the U.S. in February.\\nG7 is the most accurate CGM ever launched and the market's reception to G7 has been exceptional. Customers and clinicians have been thrilled with the new form factor, product performance, and ease of use and payers wasted no time establishing coverage as they recognize the clear value proposition that G7 provides. We immediately started to see a change in prescribing patterns once this product reached the market. And this trend became even more pronounced as we completed the largest expansion of coverage in our company's history.\\nIn mid-April, Medicare coverage went live for people with type 2 diabetes, using basal insulin only, as well as certain non-insulin-using individuals with hypoglycemia risk. Between this decision and the broad commercial coverage that quickly followed for the basal markets, we have effectively doubled our reimbursed population in the U.S. This has completely changed the market landscape in the U.S. With broader coverage available and a new product that greatly simplifies the prescribing process, we've attracted a sizable new cohort of clinicians to our ecosystem.\\nIn fact, in 2023, we expanded our prescriber base by approximately 40%, and we're not stopping there. We have always known that the primary care channel would become increasingly important as our business evolves. Much of the work our commercial team has done in recent years has been tailored to this market. And we are now seeing the direct result of that effort as more than 70% of our new scripts are being written by primary care physicians.\\nThese relationships are not only critical to help us reach the millions of insulin-using individuals who have not yet started on CGM but also the tens of millions with broader type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and beyond. Based on the success of our team in 2023 and the magnitude of these future opportunities, we are excited to continue our investment in our U.S. sales force this year. When we have a presence with prescribers, we win.\\nNow, it is up to us to continue to expand that prescriber pool. We are already seeing more clinicians want to incorporate Dexcom CGM earlier into patients' care plans as they recognize our unique ability to drive behavior change, sustainable outcomes, and greater accountability. This is why we are thrilled to be introducing our newest product, Stelo, later this summer. Stelo will be the first CGM designed specifically for people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin.\\nLeveraging our leading sensor platform, we have built a custom software experience that is tailored to the needs of this population. Stelo will feature a 15-day wear time and launches a cash pay product while we build our case with payers for broader coverage. With several trials currently underway, we will continue to add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating DexCom's unique ability to drive greater health and economic outcomes for all people with diabetes. The launch of Stelo also presents a great opportunity to bolster our evidence with a large collection of real-world data as we see the impact this product is having on our customers.\\nWe filed Stelo with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, leaving us well on track for our highly anticipated launch this summer. As our product portfolio continues to grow, it provides a greater glimpse into the future potential of our company. We have built a platform technology that we can customize to provide creative solutions for different populations. Our redesigned software infrastructure is a key component to this, as it enables much quicker iteration and greater connectivity.\\nConnectivity has always been a distinct advantage for DexCom. And with our recent filing of direct-to-watch with the FDA and new G7 pump integrations, we are further advancing this leadership position. We will also continue innovating on our hardware technology, with our current efforts focused on launching an extended wear sensor across all of our product offerings. As we look at the significant opportunity ahead of us, we are as excited as we've ever been.\\nAs I said at our Investor Day this past summer, we are just getting started. With that, I will now turn it over to Jereme for a review of the fourth-quarter financials. Jereme?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.035 billion, compared to $815 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis.\\nAs a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $769 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $606 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27%. Between the ongoing success of G7 and our significantly improved access in recent months, the momentum in our U.S.\\nbusiness continues to grow. In fact, we delivered our fastest quarterly U.S. growth rate since the beginning of 2021 as our revenue accelerated for the third quarter in a row. International revenue grew 27%, totaling $265 million in the fourth quarter.\\nInternational organic revenue growth was 23% for the fourth quarter. We continue to execute very well across our international footprint and again took share in Q4 as our global access work and product portfolio strategy have helped broaden our reach in many markets. Our fourth-quarter gross profit was $664 million or 64.2% of revenue, compared to 66.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year decline in gross margin was expected as G7 was a much larger percent of our product and customer mix in Q4, compared to a year ago.\\nAs a reminder, G7 has a higher cost profile than G6 today but we expect this to change in the coming quarters as we drive greater volume through our G7 lines. As it reaches scale, we continue to expect G7's margin profile to improve upon that of our G6 platform. Operating expenses were $421 million for Q4 2023, compared to $372 million in Q4 of 2022. This quarter was another demonstration of our commitment to being disciplined and thoughtful with our spend.\\nOur operating expenses grew at half the rate of revenue this quarter, and we delivered nearly 500 basis points of operating expense leverage compared to last year. This extended our streak to eight straight quarters of at least 250 basis points of year-over-year opex leverage. Operating income was $242.7 million or 23.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $172.1 million or 21.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million or 31.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $237.1 million or 29.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nNet income for the third quarter was $202.8 million or $0.50 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the year with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Having financial flexibility allows the organization to take advantage of opportunities. Case in point, we executed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program mentioned on our Q3 results.\\nThrough this transaction, we were able to offset the remaining dilution related to our maturing 2023 converts, while purchasing our stock at what we view as an attractive price. As Kevin mentioned earlier, our free cash flow grew by 70% in 2023 as our business continues to scale and become more efficient. As our cash flow profile continues to grow, it only adds to our significant financial flexibility. This allows us to continue to invest behind our meaningful organic growth opportunity while assessing strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis.\\nTurning to 2024 guidance. As we stated last month, we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.35 billion, representing organic growth of 16% to 21% for the year. This guidance assumes continued momentum in the type 2 basal-only population in the U.S., the expansion of Dexcom ONE on the G7 platform into new geographies, and the launch of Stelo in the summer of 2024. It also assumes the divestiture of our non-diabetes distribution business in Australia and New Zealand this quarter, which represented around $30 million of revenue in 2023.\\nFrom a margin perspective, we expect full-year non-GAAP gross profit margin to be in a range of 63% to 64%. Operating profit margin to be approximately 20% and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 29%. Our gross margin guidance reflects the ongoing conversion from G6 to G7 within our customer base and the associated scale that comes with that process. Below gross margin, we'll continue to be very diligent with our spend in 2024, while investing strategically behind multiple growth opportunities.\\nWith that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\\nSean Christensen -- Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then reenter the queue if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you. Well now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. I'll offer up for the second time congrats on a really good quarter. I wanted to tie two ideas together. The first is the great operating margins we saw in the fourth quarter, came in well above the street.\\nAnd in the slide deck presentation, you have the slide about making progress on the 15-day sensor. And the question here is really, one, any updates on the time frame of when that G-Series 15-day sensor will be approved? And how to really think about where that could take the good operating margins you put up here and what you've guided for next year and where that could really take it in the future? Thanks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Robbie. This is Kevin. I'll take the 15-day sensor timing, and then Jereme can talk about the numbers and the effect on operating margins going forward. As we've said earlier this year, we're in the middle of clinical testing and scientific evaluation of some fundamental science changes to the sensor, that will make it more reliable for that 15-day period.\\nOne of the reasons that we've done so well, two things: the accuracy of our sensor and the performance of our sensor over time but combined with the fact people expect to get a certain amount of days from a sensor and we deliver what we tell them we're going to do. And we want to make sure that 15-day experience is every bit as good as the 10-day experience that we offer now. So, we're making a few slight changes on a science basis. We'll run a clinical study, file that, and we certainly would expect to get approved.\\nBut right now, we're still evaluating some of the technologies. And we really won't provide a lot of color until we're filed, and we see we're on a path toward approval.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. And then to your question longer term on operating margins, we've done a really nice job to date, creating leverage and opportunities within our operating margin profile. And despite some of the moves in the channel mix changes we've made on the top line, we've been able to maintain a gross margin, based on a lot of the work we've done around design to value and a lot of the scale that we've been able to achieve. But when you think about 15-day, it provides a real big opportunity for us to think about both leverage from a gross margin and then operating margin profile, but also opportunities to grow the business in areas profitably that maybe it would be a little bit more of a challenge with the 10-day product.\\nSo, it is absolutely the No. 1 effort going on in the organization. It does provide us lots of flexibility to either, a, continue to grow the business; or b, deliver operating margins that can be world-class over time. So, I think longer term, there's a lot of opportunities there.\\nWe're not ready to particularly lay out what that is. We've obviously given our 2025 LRP. And we'll execute to that, but I do think it provides real long-term opportunities for this company to deliver back to shareholders and take advantage of opportunities globally.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong end to the year.\\nIt's great to see. I'm going to ask this question about -- we're hearing more about potential competition coming to market. And I would just love, Kevin, if maybe you could highlight for us the competitive moats that DexCom has built. Obviously, we don't know much about what this competitor is planning to bring to market.\\nBut maybe if you could just highlight where you think DexCom is from a competition perspective and how defensible your share is here. Thanks so much.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, I appreciate that question. First and foremost, we can start with the core technology and the fundamental beliefs we've had here as a company. The performance of our centers has been unparalleled. We've got over 1 million years, for example, and AID systems with great outcomes and patients who have done very well there.\\nWe've built our platforms on connectivity. One of the features that I've talked with the engineers about and kind of complained about because it took a lot of time to engineer. We can connect up to three devices at the same time. This is the type of connectivity that our competitors have not put into their platforms, and it's a feature that's very important to our patients, which is the reason, for example, why we just filed our direct-to-watch features with the FDA.\\nOne of the other things our competition thinks about as they look at us today, and they think this is where we're going to stay. We're not. We certainly have new pipeline efforts across all fronts on the technology side, better connectivity communications, software investments. We've had to evolve from being literally a medical device software company to being a world-class software organization over the past couple of years.\\nAnd it has been an evolution for us and it's been a big investment. So, we've looked at the areas to invest to make ourselves stronger and made investments there. Now, that's on the technology side. Here's the other piece of this.\\nWe've spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years, getting fully automated factories up and running both here in the United States and our new factory in Malaysia that opened midyear, and that is a tremendous facility. But we built out those automated lines there, and we just turned ground on what will be our next world-class factory over in Ireland that would open in 2026. There's a huge investment that has to be made to play in the CGM business going forward, particularly at the scale and the performance that we see now. And we've made those investments and done those things and evolved as a company.\\nSo, we think we're very well positioned, and we'll see where everybody else comes. But we're comfortable. Well, let me rephrase that, we're never comfortable. But we believe we've done all the right things.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Yeah. I wanted to focus on Stelo.\\nYou expect this product to add approximately, I think, 100 basis points to your growth in '24, which is almost $40 million in six months. So, that's a pretty healthy number for only half a year. Kevin, what's informing your confidence in the launch? How big could this product be over time? And what are the margin implications? Thank you.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nLarry, thanks for the question. And we have guided at 1%. The purpose of this launch is to get this product out here and learn. And as we look at that 1% of revenue number, we certainly have models that build and support that.\\nAnd we believe in designing this product for the type 2 non-insulin user and others that we're targeting the right segment to go after that. Our most important experience with Stelo is learning and getting it out there and starting to develop and grow this new market. We're confident that this product over time can become a very, very large portion of our business, and this can be a very large segment within our markets. This year's launch is all about learning more than anything else.\\nAnd we have a model for that 1%. I would love to exceed it. But if we learn all the lessons that we need to learn, this is not a backbreaker for our company and our guidance either. So, the most important thing is to get the product out there and to learn more than anything else.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. And then to your question on margin, we're not necessarily talking about it from a gross margin perspective. That will come in time, when we start to release more details around it, Larry. From an operating margin, yes, this is something we're going to invest in.\\nAnd so, when you think about it from an overall company margins, certainly, as we invest in this and we invest in launching it, there will be some sales and marketing, but it's an investment we're going to make this year. And we're going to make that investment in this product because we believe in the future, and we're going to do so and still expand operating margins as a company. So, you can be safe that we're going to be very, very careful and measured about how we invest our dollars, but know that this is part of the investments we've set aside as an organization while still, again, improving profitability.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open.\\nMathew Blackman -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate you taking my question. Maybe for Kevin and Jereme, you obviously mentioned sales force and the PCP channel. Can you just remind us, at least today, what kind of PCP sales force coverage you have? And then more importantly, sort of leaning into your comments, Kevin, about investing, seemingly incrementally in that channel this year.\\nWhat does that mean in terms of spend magnitude, spend timing? And how much more coverage are you expecting to add with these investments or any other way to frame what you're trying to accomplish? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, thanks for the question, Matt. So, when you think about the investment, we are going to expand that sales force. And today, we have a good amount of coverage.\\nIt's tens of thousands of primary care physicians and predominantly the entirety of the endocrinologist space. But as you start to think about basal coverage expanding, the opportunity ahead of us certainly Stelo out on the horizon, we found there was an opportunity to continue to expand. And as we know, CGM, specifically Dexcom CGM, can play a very important role in how folks manage their diabetes. We know that having those call points is helpful.\\nSo, we are going to expand, and you can take a look at LinkedIn for the amount. There's quite a few openings out there, in terms of the size of it. So, we'll expand our sales force, and we will get more coverage. In terms of the cadence, the LinkedIn -- recs are out there right now, so you'll see us hire over the course of the first quarter.\\nObviously, then the fully loaded burden associated with those reps will take place over the back half of the year, so Q2 through Q4. So, that's how to think about the cadence of that. But again, that's all contemplated in the overall guidance we've provided, the 20% operating margin. So, expect it as part of typical work that we do around creating leverage in the business and investing where we need to.\\nBut if you're thinking about it for a cadence over the course of the year, expect the hires to be made over the course of the first quarter. And then for folks to ramp up and be part of our run rate really Q2, through the balance of the year.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question here on international.\\nI think you've reminded us that you'll be selling a non-CGM business in Australia and also going direct in Japan. I wanted to understand the cadence for Q1 versus the rest of the year. And also, any sort of comments you could make on G7, being on the Dexcom ONE platform? Just an all-around international question there.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks, Marie. And we'll give you some context. So, the non-CGM business, that effectively is gone at this point.\\nSo, that's why we've been comfortable pulling it out and talking about it to organic. So, this quarter, you can expect -- we talked about $30-ish million last year. The math on that, you can kind of do the allocation by quarter. That's out as of this point, for the most part.\\nAnd so, think about that in the quarter, Japan certainly a similar type thing. We talked about it in Q4 being effectively nil. I'd expect a similar contribution in the first quarter. And then as we start to take that book of business or that business live in the second quarter and expect it to start to contribute, as we build that business back up over the course of the year.\\nSo, those are really the international kind of timing. So, Q1 will be the heaviest burden, in terms of as we transition through that. As it pertains to Dexcom ONE on G7, great news is, I think we press released it a couple of days ago, four countries have launched. And so, that has come out.\\nIt is now out there today. Those four countries our first foray, and we're getting great feedback from early adopters within those countries. The expectation is we have a cadence of launches of Dexcom ONE on a G7 form factor, really over the course of the year. So, I'd expect a lot more press releases around where and when we're launching that but expect that to really take place over the course of the year, which gives us a lot of confidence again in Dexcom ONE being a really incredible growth driver for the long term.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.\\nJeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\\nHey, guys, good afternoon. Maybe I'll just keep it on that international point. I think this is the first quarter in a while we've seen international growth below the U.S. growth.\\nAnd if I look back the last few quarters, I think you've gone 40%, 30%, 23% here on the organic growth rate. Just help us understand kind of where that international versus U.S. growth might settle out here in 2024. Would we expect them to be similar to each other? Does International continue to slow for any reason? And as I think about some of the competitive AID approvals that have happened over in Europe, especially with one of your -- with a competitive CGM.\\nJust how are you thinking about the stability of your maybe installed base on the AID side over there versus win rate for new AID systems there? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Hey, thanks, Jeff. So, as you think about the cadence -- so thanks for the question on international. As you think about the cadence over the course of the year, certainly Q4 was buoyed by a few different -- or way down, I guess, I'd say, by a few different things.\\nWe talked a little bit about earlier about the Japan business and really the revenues were effectively nil as we make that transition. And so, that's a negative grower in the quarter. And then the non-diabetes business was really flat. And so, when you think about the business being historically a pretty significant grower, those pull you down.\\nAs you start to exclude those things, we are still growing quite well. In fact, all of the core businesses where we operate today, U.K., Germany, Australia, etc., all continue to grow relatively consistently between Q2, Q3, Q4. There are just some ebbs and flows. But for the most part, those all should do well.\\nSo, then you think about what does that mean going forward? We haven't changed our stance that the OUS business, the international business as a percentage of revenue by the end of 2025 will be bigger than it is today, about two-thirds/one-third, where that split today is more like 70/30 or 72/28. So, I think on the whole, expect the international business with all of the opportunity out there, with certainly the underpenetration we have today, to grow faster than that of the U.S. business over the coming years. That's not to say that we're not incredibly bullish on the U.S.\\nbusiness. Look, if we can outperform on both of those, we'll do the work on both. But at least that's in our LRP. As you think about competitive systems and AID, we are highly confident in what we have to offer.\\nOur product, there's multiple different reasons why we believe our product is special in that space. Kevin alluded to a little bit about it earlier around Bluetooth connectivity is one. I'll just give you an example there. Someone can be on a pump, can talk to their phone, and can be on a direct-to-watch application, all while on our product.\\nNo one else can offer that. We are the only one that can do that. And as you think about this population, which really needs and deserves, quite frankly, the technology to manage their diabetes, we believe that that is a differentiator and a meaningful differentiator going forward. Add to that the millions and millions of years that we're compiling on these systems, we feel highly confident that when we sit in front of a physician, we sit in front of an endocrinologist and we sit in front of a parent, a child that needs an AID system, we feel confident that we are the choice.\\nWe'll continue to battle and make sure that that message continues to go out there. But as we think about that international book of business, we continue to feel very confident even post launch of a competitive system, we'll do incredibly well there.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.\\nMatt Taylor -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could update us on the cadence of data that we could expect to see this year, not only around -- you mentioned before, GLP-1 data that could come from you or from investigators. And then also on Stelo, are we going to see anything on that at upcoming conferences or from you before, during, or after the launch?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo. This is Kevin. I'll take that. We don't really -- we don't need a clinical trial for Stelo as far as getting that product approved.\\nThere is a lot of data on use of continuous glucose monitoring, particularly DexCom systems in this type 2 diabetes world that will be published by investigators over the course of the next several months. And we'll reference to that, and we'll talk to you about that. We know -- we have a very good idea where this data comes out because we've seen in all our studies patients have better outcomes or healthier. We end up saving the system money.\\nAnd those are the outcomes that we're hoping to drive with Stelo over time. With respect to GLP-1s, again, the list of studies ongoing is very large. And there are studies where CGM is an element. Again, we expect those studies when they're published to demonstrate the same things that we've talked about before that the use of the CGM with the GLP-1 provides a better result, than a study without it.\\nAnd those studies we published over time, we don't control those investigators. But we expect good data over the course of the year.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHey, thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to understand a little bit more, Kevin, if you could give some more clarity on how you think of reimbursement pathway for Stelo could look over the next couple of years? What do you think is needed to open reimbursement up for that product and how you think that would look if it would be done in a more traditional way or do you think it could be done kind of more one-off like the Levels program with UnitedHealthcare?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nOur goal is to do this in a more traditional -- for time. As we've said earlier, we'll launch the product as a cash pay product and have a cash pay option, a cash pay that people can get into and purchase the product. We will accumulate data from those users over time. We'll accumulate data again from the clinical trials that we see out there and ultimately build a case for reimbursement for this product.\\nI think over time, we certainly expect to go to CMS and have people with type 2 diabetes, who are on insulin, covered at some point in time by that group because again, our goal is to spend less money in the healthcare system, and we're one of the few technologies that enables an outcome of that nature. So, we see it being more traditional and working with payers and the various government agencies over time. The programs we will continue to support, we're happy to support them and be partners with them. But I think over time, we need to have a more traditional reimbursement path.\\nAnd that can be -- the partnerships and the relationships can be the only way. On top of that, we'll continue to develop our tools around Stelo. This first generation that we launch is going to be our first pass app. We will have numerous iterations over the course of the first 24 months of that product.\\nIt really makes it a much more inviting and engaging product and lead people to better experiences. So, stay tuned for what we have to say on that front over the next 12 months. It's going to be very exciting.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citigroup. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Nice quarter. A couple of questions, two related ones. Can you sort of give us the guidance for tax and how to think about net interest expense? And then the one that strikes me as somewhat more interesting is I think your LRP is for 21% operating margins.\\nAnd this is the second quarter in a row where you've bypassed that number. So, why is 21% still the right number to be had? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Yeah. So, we'll start with tax. I think this year, we kind of dropped down to closer to that 26% range.\\nWhile we don't necessarily guide year by year to tax, the goal is over the course of the next three to five years to get down into the low 20s. So, I would expect it to continue to come down every year as we grow into the tax structure that we've put in place. In terms of net interest income, some of that -- it's one of those -- it's a bit of a difficult one, but just given where interest rate is going to go over time. But it's pretty straightforward that our cash interest cost is pretty low just given our converts.\\nAnd so, you can basically take a look at the cash on the balance sheet, multiply it by about 4%. And that gets you to about where you'd be for the year. Again, we'll have to keep you updated as interest rates change over time. But that's the other way to think about it.\\nAnd then from an operating margin perspective, we gave the 2025 LRP. That's a 21%. Your point is valid. If you take a look at our guide this year at 20% and our gross margin of 63% to 64%, if we hold true to our 65% gross margin in 2025, which is absolutely our belief, you're already there at 21% of margin.\\nSo, I absolutely understand the mathematics. It just means we're ahead. We're ahead of our LRP, but we're not necessarily willing to update it at this point. We'll come forward and we'll update it at some point in the future.\\nBut I think it's a good thing. We've done a lot of work around this, Joanne, around getting lean and making sure we drive leverage into the business. And the great news is as we are ahead. And so, that's a good spot to be in, and we'll continue to do so.\\nOne other maybe caveat just I think it's important to note on the year. I think you asked the question a little bit about the year and why are we on the year. We're making some good investments this year in the organization. We're launching Stelo, and we talked about that being a significant investment in the business.\\nWe're certainly doing a lot of work around our sales force. And if you recall, a few years ago, we did some work around that, and we took a step back on margin. We're going to do all that and still step forward. We're going to go direct in Japan this year.\\nThat's another thing that we're making an investment in. And then all the work Kevin referenced around the clinical work that we're doing around continuing to improve our product. We're going to make all those investments and still deliver an expansion of operating margins. So, I think it just goes to show you, we're building the levers in here.\\nBut I think you can see that we're building and that you can rely on us longer term to continue to drive that through the business.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\\nMatthew O'Brien -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the domestic performance, there's been a clear acceleration in the back half of '23 on a two-year stacked basis. And I'm wondering specifically if that's just basal that's helping there.\\nIt looks like it's as much as 200, maybe 250 basis points of the acceleration. Is that the primary contributor to the domestic acceleration? What should we think about in terms of basal contribution to the topline this year? And are we inflecting right now as far as basal adoption goes with CGM here in the States? Thanks.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. It's a good question. Let me maybe just give some color as to how we're thinking about the guidance. As you see the performance in the back half of the year, a lot of that has to do with being the most accurate sensor, launching with the G7 form factor, and then, of course, having the basal coverage there.\\nAnd so, when you think about it, and you can see the sharetaking when you look at script data, we are taking share. And having the sensor -- the most advanced sensor on the market is the driver there. So, that's taking share. Now, within those spaces, basal is a contributor, no question.\\nAs that category expands and we take share within that category, that does contribute to the overall numbers. And so, you are right, basal is a contributor, but it has as much to do with us taking share as it does with category expansion. So, think about both of those as contributors. As you think about 2024, we've talked a little bit about the adoption rate, basal in total, adopting in this back half of the year around 9% to 10% per year on a per annum basis.\\nThe guide assumes about 8% there. And so, I think you can assume that was the case. Our long-range plan was more like 6% to 7% per year. So, we are seeing basal going faster than what was in our long-range plan.\\nAnd what's great about that is as we continue to take share and the category grows a little faster than expected, that will help contribute over the longer haul. So, hopefully, that gives you some context to how we're seeing basal. It absolutely is a contributor. I don't want to overstate the fact though that basal because, quite frankly, our intensive insulin businesses continue to do really, really well, and you see us taking share there as well.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nI'd just add to Jereme's comments, Matt. If you look at the second half of the year, that's when G7 rolled out. There is a direct correlation to G7 launching and the acceleration of our growth. It really was an important event.\\nAnd the other thing that just as a consequence of what you saw, again, this supports what we're doing in the U.S. with respect to our field sales expansion. We do need to spend more time with physicians who aren't as familiar with our technology as they would have been in the past. And as I said on the call earlier, where we call on somebody, we win.\\nWe do very well. So, we need more calls. We needed more feet on the street and more voice, given the acceleration that we saw and the good things that we saw happen over the second half of the year. So, it all flows together nicely.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Margaret Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.\\nMargaret Andrew -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe spin back to non-insulin. When we kind of run our market models, non-insulin adoption seems to have meaningfully increased, probably for you as well as certainly for the market the last couple of years.\\nAnd again, our numbers probably aren't perfect, but maybe the market's not at 1 million users in the U.S. Could get there this year, and that's a pretty sizable amount. So, I guess, one, are these meaningful patient adds to DexCom already in 2023? And what drove that? And going back to the Stelo guidance of $40 million per year, we can obviously throw some assumptions around ASPs or patient adds, but regardless of what those inputs can be, it pretty quickly gets you to $200 million plus sales in 2025, which is a pretty meaningful chunk of the chain. So, I guess, is that correct? Why could it be right or wrong? And how much of that could be incremental to the initial LRP that you provided in '23? Thanks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nJereme can probably get into more detail than me. It is a part of our business today, Margaret. We do have some non-insulin users for our product. We have some plans that actually cover non-insulin users for CGM.\\nAnd we've seen -- had wonderful experiences there. We also have not an aggressive cash pay program, but a cash pay program nonetheless, where non-insulin users have access to our product through some very traditional distribution channels outside the pharmacy and outside traditional DME. So, some of those individuals have purchased CGM and use it on the non-insulin front as well, and we continue to support programs. But it is not a remarkable chunk of our business.\\nIt has not been a tremendous driver of our growth. It has grown, but it hasn't been a significant percentage. As we look going forward, certainly, again, we gave guidance of 1% for 2024, and we're committed to that. And that certainly is our forecast and what we've guided.\\nWe're most committed to learning because what we're really interested in is a number like $200 million, like you're talking about for 2025 and to be positioned with the right product there. With respect to pricing and how to launch that product, we're going to have tremendous flexibility as this is a cash pay program. And it's not labeled for the current population where we have reimbursement, and where we're reimbursed for our products. So, we believe we'll have, again, flexibility to grow that.\\nAnd growing profitably. So, again, we have a 15-day product going into that market. So, we will have lower COGS. And we're developing a lot of things around that as it rolls out.\\nAs you see, we really are changing the business model to serve this type of individual versus those we've served up to this point in time. We're going to offer a different experience and we'll definitely meet their needs across the board. So, we're bullish on it over time, and it could be a very big number in 2025. That's what we're planning on.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\\nJayson Bedford -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Just on gross margin, I think we came in the last year thinking gross margin would be lower in the second half. It wasn't. I'm guessing revenue levels play a part there.\\nBut outside of price and mix, what weighs on gross margin in '24? And then just as a related question, you had some encouraging comments on Malaysia, and I think you alluded to it, but at what point do we see Malaysia and G7 starting to have a positive impact on gross margin?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHey, Jayson. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Last year, when we made the assumption on what the margin looked like, the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition.\\nWe had a range of assumptions. But the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition would take place perhaps a little bit earlier. And some of that had to do with timing of when the AID systems were available in the market and coverage, and how that goes over time. And so, it took a little bit longer.\\nAnd as a result, we outperformed on margin and it gets back to G6 cost less to make the G7 today. And still, a majority of our users, our legacy base, still sit on the G6 system. With the launch of Tandem and Control-IQ integrated with G7 and obviously, the limited launch with Omnipod 5 coming out here in the back half of Q1, and then obviously, a launch sometime later in the year, we do believe that base starts to move over quicker. And so, what you have there is as that takes place, Jason, you have that shift from a lower cost to a higher-cost product weighing in the start of the year.\\nAnd hence, that's why the margin goes where it goes. Now, in the back half of the year, assuming that base transitions and our models show that over the course of the year, that should. The equilibrium should balance then tilt in the favor of G7. It puts us in a position exiting the year where G7 should be, and we'll have to give you updates on the base as the year progresses, but it should be lower than G6, within at that point, it should be accretive.\\nAnd that would be the exit rate leading now to '24 and then, of course, then bodes well as we move into 2025 and beyond. So, that's the big driver. It's just when does that base transition. And when it does, when do we have that cost kind of equilibrium? So, again, we thought it was going to happen in the back half of 2023.\\nIt didn't take place. We outperformed there in 2023 as a result. Probably going to take place here in the first half of 2024.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Will Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\\nWill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just kind of a follow-up.\\nJust trying to get a color, granularity if possible as you look at the growth in the business and kind of Matt O'Brien's question, but the contribution from basal, hypo, intensive, and type 1, just is it kind of shifting to that order these days where it's more of the basal and hypo and the intensive type 2, is really the new patient growth? And then if so, how should we think about that cadence as you continue to move forward? Thanks.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. I mean, if you think about 2024 at least, 2024, the main contributor to new patients or at least revenue from new patients is still going to sit in the intensive insulin, so the type 1 and type 2 insulin-intensive patients. And that still is where the combination of those two makes up a majority of the new revenue over the course of the year. Basal is catching up, and basal is doing a nice job of catching up, but those in still part of our core business is still actually driving the underlying business.\\nNow, over time, we do expect basal, given it's a larger population to do very, very well. We'll have to give you more of an update as we get into 2025 and beyond as we get closer to that. So, incredibly bullish on the long-term opportunity there with basal. But think about at least 2024, our core business is actually still driving a lot of the growth with obviously longer-term opportunities in basal and then to your point, hypo, which is, quite frankly, still a low contributor, and then with Stelo kind of coming online as well.\\nAll of those are real opportunities in 2025 and beyond.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask a follow-up on Kevin, your response to the prior question on 15-day and timing. I heard we won't provide a lot of color until we've filed and see a path to approval.\\nThere kind of had been -- it seems like there was a thought that Stelo was kind of the appetizer this year for 15-day and maybe a broader rollout in 2025. And I don't want to -- I'm not asking you to pin down timing but is 2025 a year where a broader transition to 15-day could be affected? Or might all this testing and innovation take a little longer?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe would like to go as fast as possible. If it were on my time frame, it would be yesterday. Stelo at 15 days is a primer for that, so we can learn and gather data from those users as they use it, particularly with our current sensor configuration. As we go through the technology changes that we're making, as we dial in on those features that we're going to put in the final product, we'll get a pivotal trial started and we'll go, but we're learning each and every day.\\nWe are not in a position like we were with G7, where we're submitting an entire new system with completely new hardware and new features and new manufacturing lines, new suppliers, new everything. This 15-day product, we built on the same platform our current G7 is built. So, the time from finishing and pivotal to filing is not going to be near as intent and difficult as it was, with the last product, things such as security and Bluetooth and stuff. We worked through all those issues already.\\nSo, right now, it's really refining the science and getting to 15 days and getting that reliability and quality level that our patients expect from us. We don't view this as an extremely -- I think '25 is a reasonable assumption, but I'm not going to give you an end date as to when because there's too many variables. But we're certainly headed down a path along that type of speed and then we'll see where we land and give you more updates along the way. I just -- filing things or starting things.\\nWhat's important to us is getting things done. And those should be your milestones as well. So, we'll keep you posted, but that's where we are.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is open.\\nChris Pasquale -- Nephron Research -- Analyst\\nThanks. Congrats on the quarter. Wanted to ask a couple of questions about Dexcom ONE and the progress there. I think you had said you expected it to account for about 30% of international new patient starts in '23.\\nCurious if that's where you ended up and what portion of new patient starts you expect it to be in '24.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Yes, we did -- we thought it was going to be about a third of patient starts in 2023 outside the U.S. It was closer to about a quarter of new patient starts.\\nSo, a little bit behind there. Some of the tenders took a little bit more time to get on and -- so it was still a really good year for us, but a little bit behind where we had started the year, at least on the expectations. This year, we expect it to be more and a bigger contributor as a percentage. So, if you think about last year, that was certainly the case.\\nThat was on the G6 form factor. Very excited about, obviously, coming out here on the G7 form factor here in 2024 and the four countries that we already launched in. So, our expectation is a bit bigger percentage, while we haven't necessarily given that number, expect it to be bigger and the team wants it to be bigger as a percentage of new patients outside the U.S. in 2024.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask a follow-up on the type 2 hypo non-insulin -- hypo indication that has coverage.\\nWe didn't think it would move as fast as type 2 basal. But I think you guys talked about a bigger patient opportunity in the U.S. than the type 2 basal patient opportunity. Anything that's been a bottleneck in terms of penetrating that indication? And just how do you see a deeper penetration going forward, into '24, '25, '26? Thanks a lot.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Thanks, Josh. It's an area that -- in all candor, it's gone. And we knew this is going to be a bit of a challenge.\\nIt's a big opportunity, but it's going to take a little bit more time on awareness and getting in front of the physicians and letting folks know that, hey, look, if you've had a hypo event, you do qualify. And by the way, here's how to document it. So, it has been certainly slower than basal. It's not been a real all that material contributor in 2023.\\nWhat we do know, however, is Teri, our chief commercial officer, and her team are very, very focused in getting the word out. And making sure that folks understand if they are suffering with hypo events, this technology can help, and it can help change that and that they do qualify and there is reimbursement out there. And so, it's working on that messaging and making sure that we get out there and understand where those events are taking place. That is, believe it or not, it is a challenge in understanding how to identify when those have took place so that we can get out in front of those folks, but we are working on it.\\nWe have good data around that. And then making sure we're making those physicians that are then serving those patients aware of what the requirements are for documentation so that they can qualify for reimbursement. So, there's some work to be done, but there's a team working very, very intently on it. And making sure that we do arm our sales force and then arm the community with the information needed to help it grow faster.\\nI think it's a big opportunity for us, but I think it's an opportunity that's going to take a little bit longer to penetrate. So, to your point, I think it's a driver -- it's a driver a little bit here in 2024, certainly an opportunity in 2024, but I think it's going to continue to slow roll. But over the longer haul, we do think this is a contributor over time that can be meaningful.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nI'd just add to that. It feeds to the sales force investment we're making in the states. We need to educate physicians and patients. And once you get a population of people who have positive outcomes in this space, and they go back to their doctors and those conversations start taking place, this becomes easier.\\nBut there's a lot of seeding that we have to do to do it, and we needed more feet on the street to do that.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. One clarifying one on basal. You've previously talked about framing the penetration within basal population relative to the trajectory you saw in insulin-intensive type 2 patients.\\nHow would you characterize that comparison based on where you are today and also as you're looking out over the next few years?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Yeah. So, in our long-term guide, we had talked about basal, effectively being about six to seven points of adoption as a percentage of the total population here in the U.S. And I'll start with the U.S.\\nbecause internationally, there's a coverage. As we work through coverage there, there's opportunities. But we had talked about that in our 2025 LRP. In our first couple of quarters, we saw it mirror that to your question, to your point, I should say, that it was mirroring the type 2 intensive, which was about a 9% to 10% penetration rate.\\nOur guide, at least for 2024, assumes a middle between those two, 8%. We've got a couple of quarters under our belt. It's very, very positive, but we also want to make sure we're prudent when it comes to guidance. And so, that's why we've assumed about an 8% penetration rate over the course of 2024.\\nObviously, if it mirrors that, which we saw in the back half of 2023, there's opportunities to outperform. And clearly, we're tracking ahead of our LRP, which I think is both positive signals, I think, for the business in total. But again, our guidance has been 8% as a percent of penetration. Hopefully, that helps you.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\\nSteve Lichtman -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\\nThank you. Good evening, guys. Kevin, you mentioned to an earlier question, different business models for Stelo. How should we think what the go-to-market could look like? Does it have a Dexcom ONE more direct-to-patient feel? And do you need to make any significant investments in back-office support as the denominator really expand as you go after this large non-insulin group?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThat's a great question, and that is a very pertinent topic of discussion and meeting here within the walls of our company. We are very much evaluating very efficient ways to serve such a large patient group and a patient group that may interact differently with us than those who've been on insulin over time as we build those models out. So, we are looking at distribution models that appear different than what we are doing today. So, we can most efficiently get that product to people.\\nAnd again, starting with cash pay, it gives us some opportunities to do things a little different than we've done in the past. And so, you'll have to stay tuned for that. It's a very thoughtful question and very much in line with everything that's going on here every day.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our final question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open.\\nMatt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHey, great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So, one follow-up on margins and kind of mix, as you drive G7 to be a bigger part of your business. You mentioned before, and I think we understand the ramping G7 volumes, improving gross margin and profitability of that product line over time.\\nAnd just wondering if you could share maybe how we should think about the long term. Like in other words, G7 is more profitable now. Do you have a G6 more profitable now rather just the maturity of those lines? So G7 exceeds that. Does Stelo trail G7? Does Dexcom ONE with G7 kind of trail that, maybe just some sense directionally of where those are headed over the intermediate and long term would be super helpful as you drive these volumes up.\\nThanks so much.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, maybe what I'll talk about is how we're thinking about the cost of the product. And then I think from there, we can kind of make some calls on how we think about margin from that perspective. And I'll maybe comment a little bit on the service model, which I think is also important because that will help from the operating margin.\\nSo, as you think about the G7, just the product itself, as of today, it costs more than G6. And so, that will eventually, we expect over the course of this year flip. And as you kind of get your models kind of bent out or kind of laid out, we expect to get down to a $10 sensor, irrespective of whether it's 10 or 15 days as we exit the 2025 LRP into early 2026. So, that gives you some kind of feel for where we'll get to the cost of each sensor.\\nNow, each sensor, the hardware is about the same cost, whether it's Stelo, whether it's Dexcom ONE, or whether it's the G-Series. It's the support models, the software, the support, the R&D, the investment in it, and then, of course, the service models that ultimately then change it. And so, as you think about all of the work that we put into the G-Series, the G-Series will have the highest reimbursement, but it will also have the highest service model and then the most investment in software and otherwise. Dexcom ONE is a little bit more of a different service model.\\nAnd thus, we are able to reduce the burden associated with some of the warranty and then the support cost that play into that. And then Stelo is in a 15-day form factor. And so, that's helpful from a gross margin perspective as you think through that over time. So, I think that's the way to think about the cost profile.\\nWe haven't launched the price of Stelo at this point, so we can't necessarily give you the specific margin at this point. Otherwise, maybe pretty obvious how we're thinking about it. But over time, as that comes out, I think it will help align the models. And I think there's real opportunities here as you think about a 15-day -- a 15-day product, starting with Stelo.\\nBut as that then makes its way through Dexcom ONE and the G-Series over time. Again, more levers there where there are some real opportunities in those product lines to continue to drive profitability. So, I think there's levers across all of these. I hope that gives you some context.\\nI realize I'm not giving you a P&L for each one of them, but at least it gives you some context at the hardware costs and we differentiate on the opex cost and service models and then, of course, the days of wearing each one.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you very much. It's very easy during these earnings calls to talk about percentages and margins and future technologies, financial guidance, competitors, a whole host of important engaging topics. But as we wrap up today, I really want to focus on 2023, which is truly the most remarkable year in our history. Let's review these numbers again, $700 million in organic revenue growth, more than $1 billion in EBITDA, 600,000 new customers in our active user base, standing up a plant in Asia without missing a beat, and, of course, launching our G7 product all over the world.\\nWhile best-in-class technology is foundational and fundamental to these types of accomplishment, it doesn't happen without exceptional people going above and beyond. So, as we close out 2023, I want to thank our -- I guess we're now more than 10,000 DexCom employees around the world. Incredibly well done. Thanks, everybody.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question.[Operator instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nSteve Tanal -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, vice president of investor relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, president and CEO; and Mark Kaye, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon, Morgan Kendrick, president of our commercial health benefits business; and Felicia Norwood, president of our government health benefits business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and year and recent progress against our strategic initiatives.\\nMark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com.\\nWe will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC.\\nI will now turn the call over to Gail. \\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered a strong end to 2023, demonstrating our ability to execute with agility and the balance and resilience of our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62. For the full year, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $25.22 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14.\\n2023 marks the sixth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate with a compound annual growth rate exceeding the high end of the range. This reflects the ongoing execution of our strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities, and optimize our health benefits business. In 2023, we made significant strides building upon our flywheel for growth. Carelon has and will continue to add attractive capabilities that we can scale rapidly and sustainably over the long term.\\nFor example, just a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a company specializing in infusible and injectable therapies. The acquisition expands our capabilities catering to consumers with complex and chronic needs who can benefit the most from our approach to whole-person health. Infusion services will complement our suite of pharmacy services which, today, include a fast-growing specialty pharmacy business and our advanced home delivery service, which launched at the beginning of this year. Carelon Services is poised for strong growth in 2024 with the onboarding of new clients and continued expansion of services provided to Elevance Health medical members, including the rollout of risk-based oncology products and Carelon Insights, as well as the launch of comprehensive Carelon behavioral health management services to address the whole health needs of Medicaid beneficiaries living with serious mental illness.\\nTurning to our health benefits business. 2023 marked another strong year despite a dynamic operating environment. Performance was led by the optimization of our commercial business, where our operating margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows, which will continue into 2025. Commercial customers prioritize affordability, experience, and simplicity, and we're delivering on all fronts.\\nIn 2023, a we launched a series of initiatives designed to improve and simplify the customer experience, including our associates' ability to better serve our members through the integration of AI support and natural language processing, which has significantly improved first call resolution, in addition to enhancing our claims auto-adjudication rate. We're also broadening the use of AI to automate certain aspects of our provider directory and other administrative processes, which have improved data accuracy in consumer and provider experiences. Momentum in our national accounts business is a direct result of the unique and differentiated value we offer to large employers. We continue to consolidate business with existing clients, achieving excellent retention and winning over 75% of employers who ultimately switch carriers despite a smaller pipeline of new accounts for 2024.\\nIn our individual business, we positioned our products thoughtfully to drive profitable and sustainable growth, and we're pleased with our performance in 2023. We're looking forward to even stronger membership growth this year as we focus on maximizing access to care for redetermined Medicaid beneficiaries. Our relentless focus on affordable products, superior customer experiences, and simplicity is yielding strong results. After growing commercial membership by over 400,000 members last year, we are poised to grow by another 750,000 in 2024.\\nMedicaid eligibility redeterminations remain ongoing and, in many states, have accelerated their redetermination processes. To date, over 70% of our members who lost Medicaid coverage were unenrolled for administrative reasons. This is a challenging reality for many families, but we're encouraged that we are nearly two-thirds of the way through the process. With close to 30% of those unenrolled before September 1st having reenrolled in an Elevance Health product.\\nOur research indicates that many unenrolled members are facing barriers to reenrollment including awareness of the process and required actions to maintain coverage. To address this, we're executing an extensive renewal campaign and have reached over 3 million people with our omnichannel approach as we remain committed to supporting them as their trusted health partner. Despite accelerated membership attrition from redeterminations to date, our Medicaid business is performing well. Grades remain actuarially sound for the members we are privileged to serve, and we are innovating to meet their needs.\\nFor example, in 2024, we will expand our community connected care model into eight additional states. This program assists Medicaid members with their health-related social needs by identifying gaps and connecting members to support services in their communities. We will also launch a program in alliance with the affordable connectivity program, major wireless carriers, and Samsung that will help increase equitable access to digital and virtual health tools. The program will provide eligible Medicaid members with a curated selection of digital and virtual health tools via smartphone with no data cap at no cost, along with training materials and ongoing guidance on how to use these tools.\\nStrong performance in 2023 allowed us to invest for the long term. In the fourth quarter, these investments were concentrated in Medicare, where we remain intensely focused on building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth. This includes improving our star quality ratings and driving profitable growth in markets where we know we can win over the long term. Unfortunately, pockets of the Medicare Advantage market have remained hyper competitive despite a more challenging funding environment.\\nWhile our plans continue to offer attractive and valuable benefits, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to address product sustainability, and as such, we experienced greater-than-expected attrition in certain markets. As a result, we expect our Medicare Advantage membership to be roughly flat in 2024 on an organic basis but earnings to improve. Importantly, cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business continued to develop as we expected, and we are confident that the assumptions underlying our bids for 2024 are appropriate. With respect to stars, we have now fully implemented My Health Advocate, our comprehensive, personalized customer service model for Medicare.\\nThis has improved experiences for our members, helping them to easily navigate the healthcare system and their plan benefits. Early proof points reflect an improvement in first call resolution, a key indicator of future quality performance for our Medicare Advantage plans. We are confident that we have a solid foundation in our health benefits business, from which we will grow Carelon for the long term with many of the building blocks in place to accelerate our enterprise flywheel for growth. We are positioned to deliver another year of strong earnings growth in line with our long-term target in 2024, while continuing to invest in our future.\\nWe expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than $37.10 this year, reflecting growth of at least 12% over 2023. Finally, advancing health equity is foundational to our efforts to improve the health and lives of the individuals and communities we are privileged to serve. Our industry-leading approach received renewed recognition when the National Committee for Quality Assurance awarded its newly established health equity accreditation plus to 20 of Elevance Health-affiliated Medicaid health plans covering over 90% of our Medicaid members and making us the only national plan to have received this distinction to date. We also saw excellent progress on our ambitious goal to improve maternal health equity by reducing the disparity in preterm birth rates between Black and non-Black communities, improving the disparity gap by 5.2% relative to our 2022 baseline.\\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to our extraordinary team of over 100,000 associates. It is their collective passion and hard work that enables us to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. This past year alone, our associates logged over 225,000 volunteer hours in our communities, a record high for Elevance Health. This remarkable achievement reflects our deep dedication to making a tangible positive impact on the lives of the people we are privileged to serve and for the communities we call home.\\nAs we move forward, we will remain focused on serving our members as their lifetime trusted health partner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our new chief financial officer, Mark Kaye. Mark?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Gail, and good morning. I am pleased to join you for my first earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. As Gail shared, we delivered strong results every quarter of 2023, including in the fourth quarter, which was marked by solid top- and bottom-line growth and significant progress in the execution of our enterprise strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities, and optimize our businesses. Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62 and full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14 were ahead of expectations.\\nSince 2018, Elevance Health has achieved a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16%, surpassing our long-term target range of 12% to 15%. Operating revenue exceeded 170 billion in 2023, up 9.3% year over year, driven by growth in both our health benefits and Carelon businesses. The benefit expense ratio was 89.2% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the full year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points and 60 basis points respectively compared to the prior-year periods. This was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend, most notably in our commercial health benefits business.\\nThe adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.6% for the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points compared to the prior-year period, driven by accelerated investments made in the quarter, notably in network quality, value-based care, and customer experience initiatives designed to address key priority areas for Medicare Advantage stars. For the full year, the adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.3%, flat year over year. Operating cash flow was 8.1 billion in 2023 or 1.3 times GAAP net income. This includes the benefit of approximately 300 million of state-based payments for 2024 dates of service that we received in the fourth quarter and which will correspondingly impact operating cash flow in 2024.\\nWe ended the year with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9% in line with our targeted range. Given confidence in our outlook, we took advantage of market volatility during the fourth quarter to accelerate share repurchases. Specifically, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for 929 million, bringing total share repurchases for the year to 5.8 million shares at a total cost of 2.7 billion. Our health benefits business ended the year with approximately 47 million members, a decrease of around 570,000 year over year, driven by attrition in Medicaid associated with eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by growth in our commercial fee-based membership.\\nToday, we are seven to eight months into the Medicaid redetermination process. And while there is significant variability by state, we believe that nearly two-thirds of our members have had their eligibility evaluated. Of those unenrolled, approximately 70% have lost coverage due to administrative reasons. And we have also seen an elongation in the time some beneficiaries have taken to reenroll into Medicaid while others have transitioned on to an ACA exchange plan.\\nAs Gail noted, we are executing an extensive renewal campaign to maximize continuity of coverage Accordingly, we expect reenrollment into Medicaid continue through at least 2024 and for growth in ACA exchange plans to accelerate. This has been incorporated into our membership guidance ranges for 2024. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024. We are pleased to provide initial guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of greater than $37.10, reflecting growth of at least 12% year over year.\\nWe are focused on optimizing our health benefits business, including through the ongoing margin recovery of our commercial risk-based business, the strategic repositioning of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings in certain markets, and the transformation of our cost structure. Further, we are investing in high-growth opportunities with a focus on establishing a foundation for sustained long-term growth. We will scale Carelon's existing capabilities and add new ones in 2024 and driving incremental earnings growth and accelerating our enterprise flywheel for growth. The momentum in our commercial health benefits and Carelon businesses is partially offset by the Medicaid membership headwinds included in our guidance.\\nWe anticipate total medical membership to end 2024 in the range of 45.8 million to 46.6 million, down approximately 750,000 year over year at the midpoint. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members, with attrition driven by the net loss of approximately 930,000 members associated with changes in our footprint discussed on our third-quarter earnings call and ongoing eligibility redeterminations. Commercial membership is expected to grow by over 750,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 32.4 million to 32.8 million members. This includes over 300,000 net new risk-based members and approximately 400,000 net new fee-based members collectively driven by new business wins and strong client retention, reflecting our resolute focus on customer affordability, experience, and simplicity.\\nMedicare Advantage membership is expected to end the year approximately flat. As a reminder, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to improve the sustainability of our product offerings, and given unexpected competitive dynamics in certain markets, experienced greater-than-expected attrition. Nonetheless, these actions will help establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long term. And we remain confident in the outlook for utilization and medical cost trends embedded in our 2024 bids.\\nFinally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits membership to remain relatively stable year over year. On a consolidated basis, operating revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up low single digits. We project operating earnings for the year to be at least 10.3 billion, reflecting 9% growth with contributions from both our health benefits and Carelon businesses, disciplined benefit management, and the successful execution of our 2023 business optimization initiatives. Please note that our guidance metrics do not include the impact of pending M&A, even though we have several transactions we expect to close this year.\\nEarnings seasonality is expected to be relatively consistent year over year with slightly more than 55% of our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first half of the year and more than half of that expected in the first quarter. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our board of directors recently approved a 10.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.63 per share. This marks our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, underscoring our commitment to delivering strong results for our shareholders and the value of our balanced and resilient business model. In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the company, and I'm looking forward to working alongside the talented and dedicated team at Elevance Health to deliver on our financial targets.\\nI look forward to meeting all of you in 2024. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Once again, we ask that each participant limit themselves to a single question to allow ample time to respond to each analyst that may wish to participate in this portion of the call. For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\\nA.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Welcome on board, Mark. Congratulations to the company for another year of meeting the growth targets. And I know it's early to talk about this, but maybe you'd have to take some steps today to ensure your positioning.\\nWith 2025, you'll have the star ratings impact to overcome. When you think about that, will the company do anything differently? How do you think about the levers you have to push to offset what appears at least on the surface to be a couple percentage points of headwind from that star ratings impact. Will you step up share repurchases, accelerate investments in Carelon? How do you think about that at this early date and the ability to sustain that 12% to 15% even into next year?\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, A.J. There's a lot in there. And as you know, '25, it's a little early to opine on '25, but I'd like to give you at least a little bit of color on how we're thinking about some of the things that you mentioned. Let me start first with star ratings.\\nBecause as we shared on the last we are intensely working. Medicare Advantage is a very important business for us, and we're strategically committed to the long term. And I will reiterate this year, we felt we took very prudent actions for a long-term sustainable business and feel good about our bids. So, that positions us well for 2025 in particular.\\nIn terms of the star ratings, again, a few things going on there. We shared on our last call that on the group business, we have a number of levers at our disposal that we are able to pull, and we're still moving forward with that. And then in terms of overall star ratings, we do think that, that's going to be a multiyear initiative. But I wanted to share -- as I shared on my early remarks that we have invested at the last part of the year, and we were investing actually prior to even the announcement.\\nWe have been successful at moving all of our business into our health advocate model, and we do know that we're seeing some early signs. We don't know where the points are going to come out, but we do feel good about the investments we're making. And again, we feel really good about where our bids have come out. Broader, let me take a little bit step further back because I think your question around 25 is broader than just Medicare Advantage and stars.\\nAs I think about '25 again, not giving guidance on '25, but we do expect to accelerate growth in 2025, and we've talked quite a bit in recent calls about our flywheel for growth, which is on our improvement in both the health benefits business and our Carelon segment. We anticipate that our health benefits business is going to continue to grow in '25 after a reset year in '24. We should see an accelerated impact to that growth, which will drive revenue for Carelon. And then Carelon also has been independently scaling its multiple new capabilities, and we'll share, I assume, even more of those on the call today.\\nAnd then finally, as you know, we took some actions at the end of last year around our disciplined operating cost efficiencies, and we expect to see even greater benefits from those as we digitize and use AI in our investments. So, honestly, I think we feel that we've positioned our business very prudently, and that the balance and resilience of our enterprise and our earnings power of our health benefits in Carelon together gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. So, just a little bit more color on where we are. Thank you very much.\\nAnd next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask about the MLR guidance for 2024. It sounds like you guys are expecting margin improvement in MA, your repositioning commercial, and Medicaid is dropping pretty meaningfully.\\nBut why is MLR only flat? I would think that we'd be seeing MLR improvement. Is there some offset in there?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning, and thank you very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the 2023 just to set the context here. So, 2023 benefit expense ratio, end of the year, slightly better than our initial expectations at that 87%. And just to remind you, that represented the 60 basis point improvement year over year as well as falling in the lower half of our initial 2023 guidance range.\\nAs it relates to 2024, we are guiding to a flat benefit expense ratio of 87%, plus-minus 50 basis points. And our outlook here reflects a consistent approach to reserves and a prudent thought process around utilization, given the dynamic operating environment, especially for our government businesses. If I take a deeper look at the underlying businesses themselves, the health benefit expense ratio reflects that intentional management action we're taking in commercial. It will continue on through into 2024 around the disciplined underwriting practices and part of our margin recovery efforts.\\nAnd then certainly, on the Medicare the advantage side, continued appropriate expectations around utilization and Medicare -- medical cost trends.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark, and thanks, Kevin, for the question. Next, question please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\\nJosh Raskin -- Nephron Research -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically around the growth in Medicare Advantage to start this year. It sounds like a little bit lower than expectations.\\nAnd I'm curious specifically in the commentary you made around pockets of competition, maybe where you're seeing that, what you think is driving that. And then any specific comments on retention relative to expectations for this year?\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks, Josh, very much for the question. And just maybe a couple of overarching comments because I think it's important that I'm going ask solution Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to comment more specifically. And I think it's important to frame that we made some very specific discipline decisions and feel really good about our bids entering into this. And Felicia, we actually exited some markets very specifically that were underperforming.\\nSo, I think you have to take that into account. But she'll provide a lot more detail on kind of where we landed this year and the perspective on the market. So, Felicia, please?\\nFelicia Norwood -- President, Government Business Division\\nSure. Good morning, Josh, and thank you very much for that question. As we headed into 2024, we made some very disciplined decisions that we were going to enhance the financial performance for our Medicaid Advantage business. In the mainland, we exited a scale noted specifically certain markets that have been underperforming for us for years.\\nAnd with the impending risk model revisions, we really saw no path to long-term attractive sustainable economics in those markets. And that really represented a decline of about 84,000 members. I also want to note that we reduced supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico, both to turn around their performance after a very challenging 2023 and to position us for the three-year phase-in of the risk model revisions, which will have a material adverse impact on Medicare Advantage on the island, in part due to the higher mix of duals that we have in Puerto Rico. So, we've reset our supplemental benefits there, and in the midst of a very highly competitive bid environment, we will see membership declines somewhere in the neighborhood of about 90,000 in 2024 in Puerto Rico.\\nNow, while the decline is larger than we expected, it certainly has bolstered our confidence in the anticipated improvement in our benefit expense ratio in Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, what we wanted to do was to establish a very strong foundation from which we can grow in Puerto Rico long term, sustainably and profitably. Back to the mainland. Selling activity for AEP was actually very strong for us as we expected.\\nWhen we exclude the planned attrition on the island that we mentioned in -- on the mainland that I mentioned earlier, our net mainland Medicare Advantage membership would be on track to grow by high single digits this year, despite encountering greater disenrollment in certain markets due to very aggressive offerings by select competitors. At the end of the day, I think that we've made very thoughtful decisions around how we're going to position our business for long-term sustainable growth going forward. And we've done the things that we've always committed to do. We expect to do very well in our blue markets.\\nWe are performing better in our blue markets than the overall growth rates, and we're very much focused on a combination of balancing that perspective between margin and membership growth. So, we feel good about how we're positioning our business going forward. And as we said earlier, in light of all of these dynamics, we'd expect to have flat membership in 2024.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\\nSarah James -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst\\nThank you. You guys have some really nice margin expansion guided to for Carelon in 2024. I was wondering if you could unpack it a little bit for us as we think through the major buckets that are causing the expansion. And then also the pacing, if it's ratable as we think about the margin expansion due 2024 and then, I guess, further out as we get to 2027.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Thank you, Sarah. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon, to comment on that. And as you know, we're excited about the real flywheel opportunity that we're seeing in Carelon.\\nSo, Pete?\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nYes. Let me -- thank you, Sarah, for the question. Let me talk about Carelon Services growth. And we are very excited about the opportunity and the progress that we're making with respect to services growth.\\nI think you saw that play through in 2023. We committed to double-digit increase on revenue, which we achieved. And as it relates to our 2024 guide, you saw that we're talking about high teens, low 20s growth. And it's really playing through our strategy that we talked about, focusing in on complexities in healthcare, high-cost spend areas, and really driving capitated risk in key areas to support our health plans.\\nIn '23, we did that with our post-acute care initiative, DME, wound care. And as we move forward into 2024, I mean, Gail mentioned this in the prepared remarks, we have new offerings that are whole health full-risk opportunities, like oncology, assuming full risk in oncology as well as in Medicaid with behavioral health with the seriously mental ill population. So, these are significant initiatives that are really propelling the trajectory of our business. I would also say that -- as it relates to external growth, we're also seeing really nice improvements from that perspective and really nice momentum.\\nOur pipeline in '23 for '24 growth was much more significant. In terms of our sales this time versus last year, we've seen a real nice trajectory in our growth. And we've had a couple of really nice notable wins with the blues. I would say that as it relates to that and the opportunity with the blues, they are doing exactly what we've talked about in the past and looking closely at some of these full-risk comprehensive offerings that we're delivering in Elevance Health.\\nAnd then very interested in that in terms of the opportunities to create predictable stable cost of care for them. So, very pleased with where we are in the trajectory of growth in Carelon.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\\nStephen Baxter -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hi, thank you. I just want to come back to the Medicaid redetermination process. So, entering 2023, we're expecting some normalization of the Medicaid outperformance that you saw in years prior.\\nCan you give us an update on where that landed in 2023 compared to your initial thinking? And then just a little bit more color on what your guidance assumes for Medicaid in 2024. Does that put you back at historical norms for margins? Or should we think -- should we be thinking about something else there? Thank you.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nStephen, thanks very much for the question. On Medicaid membership, our outlook reflects the footprint adjustments we spoke about on our third-quarter earnings call and the continued attrition due to redetermination. We believe Medicaid redeterminations are approximately two-thirds complete across our Medicaid markets. And in general, we've seen more front-loaded disenrollment, notably in a few large states that have elected to adopt accelerated processes.\\nAnd then based on the trends that we've observed relative -- or related to these marketwide coverage shifts, we have adjusted our Medicaid retention assumption to be approximately 30% of our PHE related growth. We're not planning to provide point estimates for coverage transitions generally. We do, however, believe that ACA will pick up more than initially expected. While employer group coverage will gain a little bit less than initially expected.\\nBut most importantly, these updated projections are factored into our membership guidance that we provided this morning.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\\nLance Wilkes -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\nYes, thanks. Could you talk a little bit about your value-based care strategies? And what I would be interested in is from a contracting standpoint, how are you approaching that for '24 and like MA? Are you doing any sort of renegotiation to kind of hold those value-based care providers more stable in that year given the risk adjustment changes? And then how is the priority for owning those sorts of assets in Carelon change? And what's your current outlook there? Thanks.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, Lance. It's quite a bit there. But I think let me start with our value-based strategy, we've talked about on this call a number of times, and I think I would say it's remained really consistent, but we're making a lot of very good progress on that. Overall, more than 60% are in value-based care.\\nAnd in Medicare, it's even more. Specific to your question on renegotiation, we have multiple-year arrangements with our value-based providers, and we're always looking at a couple of things. One, quite frankly, to make sure that it's a win-win and we're aligned, both on cost quality outcomes and stars. So, we spend a lot of time focusing on some of the ways that we can get data back and forth more simply.\\nWe use our -- we've integrated the way we share data back and forth, and that's really around closing gaps in care and quite frankly, simplifying the process under which we work with those providers. Our goal is to make that ubiquitous across all of our value-based providers. And so, we made a lot of progress there and dramatically improve sort of the time to action with those providers. And I think that's important because, honestly, that gives them data to act, and that improves their outcomes.\\nWe have seen our value-based providers perform better in the circumstance, and we think that that's going to remain important. In terms of our strategy around ownership, we've talked about that. We -- as you know, we do have assets inside of Carelon. I guess where I would focus you more is around the specialty high-cost complex areas of specialty because that's where we think that there's a huge differentiated focus between our technology, our clinical domain expertise, and our ability to drive trend.\\nAgain, we don't need to own the providers, but we do need to have a significant role in the enablement of those care providers, and we have spent time doing that. We launched a number of new products this year with oncology, serious mental illness, and we're getting into other areas like musculoskeletal, renal, and more. And I think that's where you see the significant spend areas accelerating, and Carelon with its assets has a great opportunity. So, we expect Carelon's care provider enablement platforms continue to contribute pretty significantly Carelon's revenue meaningfully over the longer term, and we're building those assets.\\nAnd again, I'll keep going back to my flywheel where we think that will improve the performance of our health benefit plans. There's a lot of interest in -- externally in these. And Pete mentioned, we saw some nice traction in a few of these offerings this year. So, overall, I'd say very consistent focus around our value-based care enablement, and we feel like we're getting a lot of traction.\\nAnd I would focus you a lot on the specialized care specialty care, particularly on the Carelon growth opportunity. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Two on the Medicare business.\\nFirst, you talked about Medicare cost trend developing as expected in the fourth quarter. I guess I'd be curious if there are any areas that came in higher or lower than expected and what the benefit expense guidance for 2024 assumes for Medicare cost trend? And then I guess, higher level, as you reposition the Medicare business, and I understand there's several moving pieces over the next couple of years, what's the company's current view, I guess, first of the Medicare Advantage market longer term? But then second, the membership growth and margin potential for Elevance, specifically within that market context? Thank you.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you for the question. I'm going to ask Mark to address your first question, and then I'll come back and share our long-term views on Medicare.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNathan, overall utilization in the fourth quarter developed largely in line with our expectations. And that's evidenced by our reported benefit expense ratio, which came in favorable, as you know, to consensus and really to the midpoint of our initial full-year 2023 guidance range. We did see pockets of high utilization, specifically in Medicare related to orthopedics, such as knee and hip replacements and other outpatient procedures. But this is broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost-trained assumptions.\\nSimilarly, we saw a seasonal uptick in respiratory elements, including the flu and COVID, as well as increased RC vaccinations. But again, utilizations were aligned with what we planned. We'll continue to monitor our claims trends closely, including prior authorization data. We remain confident that our Medicare Advantage bids for 2024 and our pricing commercial do reflect appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Nathan, in terms of your broader question, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. As I think about the market, we still think Medicare Advantage is a very good long-term market. And as I said, we're committed to driving sustainable performance for the long term.\\nMedicare Advantage delivers really strong differentiated value for seniors. I think you have to start there. And as you look at the aligned incentives across the system to deliver better outcomes and better care, it is very -- it's a very strong marketplace, and it continues to grow. And importantly, it's incredibly popular with seniors with greater than 50% of seniors selecting Medicare Advantage today.\\nSo, that -- against that backdrop, we know seniors value stability in their benefits year over year and the items that are most important to them. And so, we have, as you heard from us earlier, look to make sure that we are in this market for the long term balancing that stability. So, with what we know is happening in this market, we can make the right benefit decisions and again, feel that we positioned ourselves and are making the right strategic investments to improve our performance. We see this business maturing, as Mark shared in his comments as well.\\nAnd again, been very intentional about our desire or decision to exit certain programs or markets and plans where we didn't think we had a long-term sustainable path to performance. And that, combined with the risk models, made that choice and then again, reposition Puerto Rico, which we believe is still a very good market, but there were some actions that we knew we had to take. So, as we look at those decisions for the long term, as Felicia shared, our business performed when you look at the mainland and take out those exits. We had very strong selling season.\\nAgain, I think that's a testament to the value of the benefits and our position. And importantly, we do believe we can grow this business profitably even in a year with hypercompetitive markets in certain cases where we outperformed the growth in our blue markets, which, again, has always been a strategy we've had is to go deeper in our blue markets and to gain more share with the value of our brand as well as in other places. So, again, we think it's a good market. We know we have some work to do in that market, but we feel we're positioning for the long term and think that we can add distinctive value for seniors as part of our focus on whole health and continuation of coverage to stay blue for life and all of their coverage.\\nSo, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nLisa Gill -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nThanks very much, and good morning. I want to focus on margin drivers. Can you maybe just spend a little time talking about the progression in 2024, getting to those targets that you have in '25? And then secondly, when I think about the margins in CarelonRx, you talked about them improving by 40 to 60 basis points. Can you talk about what the drivers are there as well? Is that Paragon Health and BioPlus, which I would assume carry better margins? Or is there something else that's really driving that improvement as we move into '24?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLisa, thank you very much for the question. I'll talk about health benefits, and I'll pass it over to Pete in a couple of minutes to talk about Carelon. On the health benefits side, we are seeing operating margins expands or expect to expand by 25 to 50 basis points in 2024. And I think about this as really being driven by three primary categories.\\nFirst is the continued underwriting discipline and the pricing actions that we're taking in commercial. 2023 really marks the end of the first full year of our efforts to recover margins from the pandemic-era lows, and we expect those supporting initiatives really to continue through 2024 and then possibly into 2025. Second one I'd call your attention to here really relates to the Medicare margin expansion. And here, as you've heard us talk about, this is about building that strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth in 2024 and striking that balance between growth and margin.\\nAnd in 2024, we leaned a little bit more toward the margin and the growth, and you see that come through in some of our outlook projections this morning. And then the third one I'd call your attention to is really the operating expense leverage. You see that we are gaining additional incremental leverage in 2024 with our guide down to 11.1% for the operating expense ratio.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nThanks, Mark. And, Lisa, your question was on the trajectory of the margins in pharmacy. So, you'll recall that this year, in 2023, we made pretty significant investments as it relates to the acceleration of BioPlus and advanced home delivery, and that puts some pressure on our margins in 2023. That will not repeat itself in 2024.\\nWe did go live with BioPlus on January 1, as well as with respect to advanced on delivery. We're really excited about that, and it's moving in the right direction. And over time, we've built those products for scale. And as that business builds and progresses, we will continue to see margin improvement.\\nSo, that is what is delivering an improvement in margin in '24.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNext question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\\nScott Fidel -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could -- just on the commercial risk enrollment guidance, if you can break that down for us between group and individual? And then on the individual piece, I'm curious in terms of what you're thinking in terms of how much of that growth comes from the catchers mitt for Medicaid. And then how you're thinking about the acuity of those lives that are coming into the exchanges from Medicaid? We know that in Medicaid, that acuity is generally rising as the redeterminations continue.\\nSo, I'm curious, though, in terms of those lives that are transitioning into the exchanges, are you thinking about those as being sort of higher or lower or in line acuity with the legacy population in the exchange market? Thanks a lot.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, Scott. I think we've got about four or five in there. So, we'll try to hit the high points of your question. Let me ask Morgan and then Mark to comment on your question.\\nMorgan?\\nMorgan Kendrick -- President, Commercial Health Benefits Business\\nYes, Scott, thanks for the question. As we think about the ACA business, we've talked about it for a while now, we're quite bullish on that segment. And as we've remarked in other quarterly reports, we operate in all rating areas in our 14 geographies where we can. And certainly, we've seen an expansion in the actual market share and the market growth actually in these geographies.\\nIn fact, it's certainly a big driver is Medicaid redetermination. As we've indicated earlier on the call today, we've concluded about two-thirds of those. We expect that to continue in 2024. And also, as we've noted in the past, we've seen an elongated period of time from when someone is redetermined and when they actually join Medicare or come on an ACA product moving along.\\nThat said, quite pleased that our growth this year is outpacing our market growth. So, clearly, we're picking up our fair share and more, quite honestly, of the Medicaid redetermined members. So, at the end of the day, this will continue. We've had a very steadfast and steady approach around the right economics and the right network strategies to draw in these members.\\nIt's very important for the business to continue. And I'm going to turn that over to Mark to speak a little bit about the margins and the separation of the various pieces that you asked the questions on.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. If I think about Medicaid rates and acuity, the conversations with the states are ongoing. We'll continue to work with them and their consultants, really to ensure that all adjustments are reasonable and reflect the risk associated with ongoing redeterminations in 2024. Our outlook for 2024 does assume a normalization of Medicaid margins -- we already have line of sight into about 70% of Medicaid premiums for 2024.\\nAnd we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the underlying rates, especially understanding the acuity for leavers versus stayers.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. And thanks, Scott. And I think you also asked about the acuity in the individual exchange marketplace. So, I wanted to just put a fine point on that.\\nOur risk profile of the members we're picking up certainly in '23, obviously, early in '24, very much aligns with the expectation of what we've historically had. So, we feel it's actually rolling out to our expectations. So, thank you for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nBen Hendrix -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nThank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on the Carelon margin question. On Carelon Services, slightly down margins in the guidance. Just wanted to see if that -- the degree to which that is associated with new risk-based arrangements or membership or to the -- perhaps to the new behavioral benefits and kind of what are the prospects for that kind of ramping up beyond 2024? Thanks.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nThanks for the questions. First of all, we're very pleased with the operating performance of Carelon. You saw that play through in 2023. I think we committed to 25 to 50 basis points of improvement.\\nYou saw 70 basis points of improvement year over year. So, that -- it's performing really well. You answered the question already as it relates to 2024. Quite frankly, we are, as Gail talked about and as I talked about earlier, launching some very significant at-risk product offerings, both oncology, seriously mentally ill population, as well as others, and that comes with a lower margin in the earlier years, but that improves over time.\\nSo, that is precisely what was creating the pressure on the margin in '24.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. And just to sort of put a finer point on it, we do remain confident in our long-term guidance that we gave in mid to upper single-digit operating margin. So, as Pete said, we think the business we're bringing on is really good. We're committed to bringing in more risk business.\\nBut in the early years, that does have a little bit lower profile. But overall, we feel very good about the long term. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nJustin Lake -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nThanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of numbers here. First, you reported $200 million-plus of positive prior year development a quarter, materially more than I think the company has ever seen in Q4.\\nJust curious, given the MLR was generally in line, can you tell us whether there were any pressure areas that worked to offset the benefit of the PYD in the quarter? And then with the benefits repositioning of Medicare Advantage, which we've clearly done, do you expect to be within your 3% to 5% target margin here for Medicare Advantage in '24? Thanks.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nJustin, thank you very much for the question this morning. We are confident that our year-end reserves are prudent and have been set consistent with historical practice. In the quarter, you are correct that we saw positive prior-year development on a gross basis, and that was indeed favorable. It's worth pointing out here that that was largely offset through premium rebates and colors, as well as the reestablishment of reserves for the current year.\\nAn alternative way to think about this is that our full-year days in claims payable decreased just 0.2 days year over year. And that's noteworthy in the context of the fact that we have observed cycle times to have actually decreased more than three days, since the end of December 2022. And that should give you a feel for our comfort level around reserves. On your second question, just relative to the long-term target margin ranges, commercial is on track to achieve our long-term goals.\\nLet's say, Medicaid is normalizing but continues to perform well. And then Medicare Advantage for now is below our long-term target margin range.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nGary Taylor -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on enrollment. I kind of thought the story for '23 was that with the intentional commercial repricing, which has been pretty successful this year, you lost some commercial risk enrollment because of that. And I'm just trying to figure out on the million plus decline in risk enrollment for '24, how much of that is commercial risk versus the expected Medicaid redeterminations.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWe're all pleased with the performance of our commercial business in the fourth quarter and in 2023. We did make meaningful progress toward our margin recovery goals in the year. I'd say January renewals have gone well. We certainly experienced to-date higher retention than we did at the same period last year.\\nRepricing actions, as you would expect, do continue to impact membership growth, but this is expected. And so, we're really continuing to expect approximately flat membership growth overall in our group risk business this year, while continuing to improve margins in line with our stated goals.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. And just again, to put a fine point, most of the losses in risk membership is driven by both the Medicaid redeterminations and the adjustment in the footprints that we've shared with you in the past. So, that really is the key driver. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\\nDave Windley -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\nThanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to go to CarelonRx on the revenue growth side. High growth in '23. Low single digits, I think, you're expecting in '24, I suspect, the BioPlus acquisition inorganically would have contributed to some of that growth in '23, but I don't think it bridges the full change.\\nSo, maybe you could add some color around the slowdown in growth, the lower growth expectations for CarelonRx in '24? Thanks.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nYeah, thanks. Excuse me. Thanks, Dave, for the question. As it relates to 2023 and the growth of around 18.6% that did exceed our initial guidance -- and as you alluded to, that was driven primarily by the BioPlus acquisition and including BioPlus and our results to a lesser extent, drug mix and trends.\\nBut I would say, as it relates to 2024, I would say we have tremendous momentum in the business. And we're really excited about how our strategy is playing through. We've talked about assuming the strategic levers that really matter in our business. We've done that with Specialty Pharmacy and BioPlus.\\nWe've done that with advanced home delivery. You heard about the recent announcement of Paragon, an infusion which we're really excited about. And then there are several new product launches that are resonating in the marketplace that we've talked about previously, like insurer access as one of the examples. And this momentum is playing through in our sales in 2024.\\nWe are having a good season. Obviously, that activity occurred in 2023. Our retention remains strong. Our sweet spot does remain in that 3,000 to 10,000 range in terms of the business that we're attracting.\\nAnd as you know, there's a little more reticence in terms of the larger jumbo accounts moving. But I would say that a couple of notable wins there. We saw a couple of wins in the 20,000 to 50,000 range. So, we're really excited about the momentum in Carelon and what we're doing strategically and how that's playing through in the marketplace.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Pete. Our next question will be our last question.\\nOperator\\nFor our final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\\nGeorge Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nYeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in after Dave. I'm going to come back to MA margins one more time. And I'm going to ask you if you could expand a little bit if there is a way to disaggregate kind of the MA margin expansion thinking about your pricing initiatives versus utilization expectation versus mix and kind of the market exits that you guys have targeted.\\nJust trying to figure if you can kind of maybe rank order the contribution on margin expansion in MA from each of those four initiatives?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks very much for the question, George. We are not looking to necessarily provide individual margin guidance within the health benefit segment. Certainly, we feel comfortable with where we're guiding to in aggregate for 2024 and the 25 to 50 basis point range. And we think that the qualitative commentary that we provided in the call today should give you enough to get a feel for how the management team is thinking about this.\\nGiven this is my first earnings call, I just want to spend a minute on capital deployment before we close out here. And I just wanted to make the point that I expect to continue with Elevance Health's existing strategic policy around capital deployment, as I believe it really strikes the right balance between growth and the return of capital to our stockholders. And just as a reminder, we are going to target 50% of our free cash flow toward M&A or organic reinvestment and approximately 50% is a return of capital to our stockholders, either via the 30% for share repurchases or the 20% for dividends. And each year may differ, but over the years, we expect to allocate capital consistent with this framework.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark. And thank you to everyone who joined us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about our future, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year.\\nThank you again for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through February 23, 2024.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug. \\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Debbie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us to review Shockwave's results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023, which proved to be another banner one for the company. During the year, we launched C2 in Japan. We converted to direct sales forces in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Canada.\\nWe launched two new products, L6 for peripheral vessels and C2+ for the coronaries. We were granted DRG codes specific to coronary IVL in the inpatient hospital setting, which pay on average about $9,000 more than codes for PCIs without IVL. We acquired and integrated Neovasc and the Reducer product, which is the first device that addresses refractory angina, an often debilitating condition that impacts a large patient population that has no good treatment options, and we raised $750 million in a convertible debt offering. We achieved record revenue of $203 million in the fourth quarter, which was a 41% increase from a year ago, and a 9% sequential increase from the third quarter of 2023.\\nOur revenue for the full year of 2023 was $730.2 million, a 49% increase from 2022 revenue. We witnessed excellent performance in all areas of the business, with U.S. peripheral and coronary businesses growing 47% and 41%, respectively, and our international IVL business growing 75% compared to 2022. Really stellar performance.\\nThe team continues to execute at a high level, and we now have over 1,500 global employees. Our products are approved in 70 countries, and we are pleased that we now have EU MDR certification for M5+, S4 and C2+ catheters and our generator. The MDR process was a long journey and required a major effort by the team. Our U.S.\\ncoronary business continues to shine, and we have a couple of meaningful reimbursement tailwinds that will support continued adoption. The new hospital inpatient DRGs for coronary went into effect in the fourth quarter of last year and additionally, physicians are now being paid when they use coronary IVL thanks to the CPT code that became effective on January 1 of this year. As we have witnessed in the past, reimbursement takes time to influence customer behavior, but we anticipate that the combination of these new payments will have a positive impact on our U.S. coronary business and will help lower the economic friction that has historically been the biggest constraint on increased utilization of IVL.\\nWe anticipate that physicians will increasingly use C2+ whenever they feel it's clinically appropriate, versus feeling pressured to only use it selectively or after exhausting all other options. We believe an IVL-first strategy is optimal for patients and is now even better economically for customers. Also on the coronary topic, we are continuing the launch of C2+, which has 50% more pulses than its predecessor C2. Isaac will talk a bit more about this later in the call, but early reception from our customers has been very positive.\\nOn the U.S. peripheral side, the prior authorization issue appears to have stabilized as our customers are learning how to navigate Aetna's increased scrutiny on peripheral procedures, and we have not seen any other payers follow Aetna's practices. Meanwhile, multiple medical societies have come together to form a working group, and they have been applying pressure on Aetna in hopes of getting them to reconsider their policy. There also has been considerable attention paid to Medicare Advantage recently.\\nAt the federal level, CMS recently announced new rules, which will make it harder to pursue prolonged prior authorization practices. There also has been some predictive recent movement among commercial payers specific to Shockwave, as HUMANA, the second largest Medicare Advantage payer, issued a positive coverage decision for IVL for their Medicare Advantage plans effective January 1, 2024. Staying on the topic of U.S. peripheral reimbursement, we are pleased to see that CMS improved hospital reimbursement by assigning peripheral IVL to new MS-DRGs.\\nThese new DRGs increased inpatient hospital payment by $4,000 to $10,000 over previous levels. Most peripheral interventions are performed in an outpatient setting. However, a majority of the hospital-based below-the-knee procedures are for the more severe chronic limb-threatening ischemia or CLTI, which makes them more likely to be performed on an inpatient basis than other procedures. This reimbursement uplift nicely complements the upcoming advances in our below-the-knee product offering that starts later this year.\\nWhile on the topic of new products, we will be focusing back on peripheral in the second half of this year with two launches. First, we will introduce an upgraded version of L6, which will go from one pulse per second to two. We witnessed a very positive response from our customers when we made this same upgrade going from M5 to M5+. Shortly after the L6 rollout, we plan to launch the E8 peripheral catheter.\\nE8 has an eight-centimeter-long treatment zone, which is twice as long as our current S4 offering and is specifically designed to treat longer diffuse lesions that are common and below-the-knee cases. We look forward to seeing our customers' response to E8. We think they're going to love it. Rounding out our future BTK offering, we anticipate the approval of our JAVELIN peripheral catheter in the latter part of the year and look forward to starting the limited market release of that product prior to an expected full market release in early 2025.\\nThat makes three significant new peripheral launches within the next year. And finally, on the operations front. Our facility in Costa Rica has gone from first shovel in the ground in June of 2022 to a validated clean room and C2+ line in December of 2023. Amazing progress, frankly.\\nWe'll be hosting regulatory audits starting this month and anticipate shipping finished product into inventory in the third quarter of this year. 2023 was a great year for Shockwave, and we are even more excited about what lies ahead in 2024. We expect revenue between $910 million to $930 million for the full year of 2024, representing growth of 25% to 27% over 2023. Before I turn the call over to Isaac to provide more color on the commercial front, I want to take a minute to thank our outgoing CFO, Dan Puckett, for the tremendous job he has done in his eight years at Shockwave.\\nDuring his time here, he was instrumental in our growth from a small pre-revenue private company to a public company with over $700 million in revenue. Dan is not only a fantastic CFO, but he is a joy to work with. He's been the biggest cheerleader for all of us, always supportive and inspiring to everyone around him and he will be sorely missed. We wish Dan well in his retirement and are pleased to introduce our new CFO, Renee Gaeta, who is jumping right in today, and will present the financials a bit later in the call.\\nAnd if he gets anything wrong, it's all Dan's fault. With that, I'll turn the call over to Isaac.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nThank you, Doug. Our record results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023 reflect outstanding contributions from our businesses and teams around the globe. Q4 2023 was strong for our U.S. coronary business.\\nRevenue grew 40% compared to Q4 of 2022, 11% sequentially from Q3 of 2023 and 15% sequentially on an average daily sales basis. The C2+ launch is proceeding well. We launched over 1,000 accounts and the product has been very well received. What is particularly appreciated is the utility of more pulses in longer diffuse lesions, eccentric lesions, and calcified nodules.\\nWe expect continued momentum in the coronary business as our sales team focuses on the C2+ launch and on communicating both the favorable reimbursement changes and additional physician fees for using coronary IVL. Revenue from our U.S. peripheral business in Q4 2023 was up 19% from a year ago, flat sequentially compared to Q3 and up 3% sequentially on an average daily sales basis. As Doug mentioned, we are seeing a stabilization of the prior authorization dynamic as providers are getting better at navigating the additional steps required for some patients.\\nWe continue to expect modest growth in the U.S. peripheral business in the first half of 2024 as we maintained a strong focus on the U.S. coronary business. We did anticipate accelerated U.S.\\nperipheral growth in the second half of 2024 with the L6 and E8 product launches. Turning to our international business. We had another record quarter of IVL sales as revenue was up 67% from a year ago, and 14% sequentially compared to Q3. We are now direct in all five major European markets: Germany, the U.K., Spain, Italy, and France.\\nSales in Germany doubled during 2023 due to the improved coronary reimbursement. We are starting to see increased usage in some of the smaller German accounts, which can now afford IVL. Germany is the largest market in Europe, and we think there is tremendous upside for coronary penetration from the current level of just over 2%. We had our first full quarter of direct sales in Italy and are very pleased with the execution by that team.\\nIt feels good to see such strong and seamless execution from the direct selling teams in Europe. We continue to drive penetration with the focus of the Shockwave sales team and the support of our marketing and physician education programs. In Japan, we completed our first year of coronary sales. We exceeded our goals for the number of accounts launched, the penetration in the launched accounts, and revenue.\\nWe have initiated efforts to develop clinical data that will support using IVL in conjunction with atherectomy and drug-coated balloons. We are working closely with CVIT, the interventional cardiology society in Japan, to ensure that IVL is available and appropriately used throughout Japan. In China, we are still experiencing the impact of the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which is slowing IVL adoption at new centers. On the positive side, adoption within centers that had IVL on the pricing list before the anti-corruption campaign started is growing nicely.\\nThat said, we expect very little revenue from China in the first half of 2024. Finally, the European Reducer team posted a very nice quarter. The teams in Germany and France are being rebuilt, and along with the established U.K. team, continue to generate revenue while testing different market development strategies and sales models.\\nWe are very pleased with the integration of Neovasc and are starting 2024 with strong teams in place to both accelerate enrollment in the COSIRA-II trial and build the international Reducer business. With that, I will turn the call to Renee to review the financials.\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Isaac, and good afternoon, everyone. I am thrilled to have joined the Shockwave team and look forward to working with all of you. Shockwave Medical's revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, was $203 million. a 41% increase from $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nU.S. revenue was $158.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 34% from $118.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Coronary products contributed $115.2 million to U.S. revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 40% from $82.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nU.S. revenue from our peripheral products was $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 19% from $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The growth in U.S. revenue during the quarter was driven primarily by increased utilization at existing accounts, supported by our continued sales force expansion.\\nInternational revenue was $44.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a 74% increase from $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Coronary products contributed $37.7 million to international revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an 83% increase from $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. International revenue from our peripheral products was $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 19% from $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Reducer product contributed $1.8 million to international revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nThe increase in international revenue over the prior year period was driven by a continued geographic expansion, particularly in Japan, the increased productivity of our direct selling teams in Europe and the momentum from our C2+ launch. Looking at product lines, our peripheral products, Shockwave M5, Shockwave M5+, Shockwave S4 and Shockwave L6, accounted for $48.1 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $40.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 19% increase. Our coronary products, Shockwave C2 and Shockwave C2+, accounted for $152.9 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $102.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a 49% increase. Revenue from our Reducer product accounted for $1.8 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $177.7 million compared to $126.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 88% for the fourth quarter of 2023, consistent with gross margin of 88% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $134.4 million, a 60% increase from $84.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $67.2 million compared to $43.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nThe increase was primarily driven by sales force expansion. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $42.3 million compared to $23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by head count growth, higher clinical-related expenses, including Reducer, and the facility expansion to support R&D. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $24.9 million compared to $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nThe increase was primarily driven by higher head count to support the growth of the business. Operating margin was 21% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $44.3 million compared to net income of $140.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we released a valuation allowance, which resulted in a tax benefit of $99 million in that quarter.\\nBasic net income per share for the period was $1.20. Diluted net income per share for the period was $1.16. Adjusted EBITDA was $68.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 20% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $56.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, I'd like to briefly recap some highlights from our full year 2023 results.\\nTotal revenue for the full year 2023 was $730.2 million, an increase of 49% compared to full year 2022 revenue of $489.7 million. U.S. revenue for the full year 2023 was $581.5 million, representing a 43% increase over 2022 revenue of $407.4 million. International revenue was $148.7 million for the full year of 2023 compared to $82.3 million in 2022, representing an 81% increase.\\nGross margin for the full year 2023 was 87%, consistent with 87% for the full year 2022. Total operating expenses were $475.7 million in 2023, an increase of 58% compared to operating expenses of $300.6 million in 2022. Operating margin was 22% for the full year 2023. Total net income for the full year 2023 was $147.3 million compared to $216 million for the full year 2022.\\nNet income in 2022 included the $99 million tax benefit from the aforementioned release of our valuation allowance. Basic net income per share was $4.01 for the full year 2023. Diluted net income per share was $3.85 for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $242.7 million for the full year 2023, a 40% increase from adjusted EBITDA of $173.9 million for the full year 2022.\\nLooking forward to 2024, we expect to continue to make significant investments to support and sustain our growth and anticipate full year 2024 operating margin expansion of up to 100 basis points from the full year of 2023. Similar to the pattern we saw in 2023, we do expect a step-down in Q1 operating margin from the prior Q4, reflecting compensation and benefits costs, which reset at the beginning of the year as well as the timing and increased costs related to our global sales meeting held in March. We ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $990.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for closing comments.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Renee, and thank you all for joining us today. 2023 was another great year at Shockwave. The team continues to execute at the highest level as we achieve our mission to help treat underserved patient populations around the globe with our innovative solutions, and we're excited to continue this work in 2024. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Good afternoon. Nice quarter, and congrats on a fantastic year and welcome, Renee, on the new role. I wanted to start on the guidance construction, the top line, $910 million to $930 million.\\nMaybe just talk about what's embedded for some of the different pieces of the business, coronary versus peripheral versus Reducer? And if I heard correctly, you said modest U.S. peripheral growth in the first half of '24, then accelerate in the back half with new product launches. Hoping you could flesh that out some. I'm assuming that's assuming some continued headwinds from Aetna, but wanted to, I guess, kind of understand what's baked into the guide for Aetna prior auths, as well as China anti-corruption.\\nAny potential impact from the step-down in outpatient reimbursement on the coronary side in the back half of the year? I'm sorry for the long-winded question.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. And we'll probably tag team on this. We are anticipating modest growth on peripheral particularly in the first couple of quarters while we concentrate on coronary. And then as we start launching L6 and E8 and turn our focus back to peripheral, we'll start seeing a step up in peripheral growth.\\nThe year will be another really strong year we anticipate for U.S. coronary contribution as a percent of the business. We anticipate U.S. coronary will be actually a larger percent of the total business than it was end of -- throughout the 2023.\\nWe obviously had a very strong international performance last year. We anticipate another strong year, although we have the China deficit. So, ex China, international is going to do very well, but we'll be losing over $10 million in -- somewhere between $10 million and $20 million in revenue that we would have -- that we had last year in China that we're not going to get this year. So, we're anticipating sort of very low single-digit revenue out of China.\\nSo, ex China, another strong contribution year from the international business. And Isaac, I don't know if you --\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nLast point, Adam, you asked about was on the outpatient -- for coronary U.S. in the second half, the outpatient payment? We don't anticipate. I mean, we're aware of the situation, obviously. We still expect baseline is that the TPT will -- is set to expire July 1, and it will expire July 1.\\nWe still anticipate the up leveling to 5194 will occur Jan 1 of 2025, but what we've seen typically with reimbursement in the U.S. is it takes time to move behavior and change behavior patterns and what -- so we've not been on this kind of good, good run in coronary, and we have a really strong coronary business and momentum right now, with the inpatient reimbursement continue to be a tailwind, the physician fee continue to be a tailwind, the C2+ launch is a tailwind, and we just don't anticipate that having the TPT expire in the middle of the year will be much of a headwind, TBD, but that's kind of what we've seen in our -- that's what we've baked into our guidance.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nYeah. That's good color, guys. Thank you for that. And for the follow-up, we'll stick with the guidance topic and switch over to margins.\\nIf I heard correctly, you're expecting up to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion for full year '24 over '23 levels. That's a little bit below kind of where the street is pre call. Maybe I would just love to hear a little bit more about kind of what's embedded in that assumption. Should we be orienting models to kind of 50 basis points kind of the midpoint of that range? Or should we start at 100 basis points kind of coming out of the Q4 call here? And yes, I just would love to hear a little bit more about the philosophy on the leverage piece.\\nThanks so much.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So, we -- as usual, we're going to continue investing in aggressively in our pipeline, both on the sort of hardcore product development side, and increasingly, the clinical trial expenses, which whether it's the trial for Reducer, the COSIRA-II study or the various trials such as DUO that we're running now or EMPOWER. We initiated multiple trials next year and they're becoming more expensive -- last year. And this year, we'll spend even more on those trials.\\nSo, big step-up in clinical spend. We'll continue to augment our global sales footprint, but the U.S. team will not be growing at the same rate that it has historically. We've -- we're not done building out that team, but the rate of change will be lower.\\nSo, the -- so you'll probably see a little leverage on sales, sort of not incremental leverage on R&D. We shouldn't see much deleveraging on R&D, but that will probably be static relative to the top line. We're still spending money right now. We're still having to expense Costa Rica, and that does not convert into inventory until later in the year.\\nAnd so, we're still having to absorb Costa Rica costs, which are not insignificant.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nI got it. And just one clarification, Doug. No change to the 500 basis points operating margin expansion over '23 levels that you outlined at the Innovation Day last year. I just wanted to confirm that's still the case.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. We've been -- we've articulated previously that it's going to be '25, '26. We're pleased that -- if this plan delivers as expected, we're very pleased with up to 100-basis-point improvement. If you want to model 50, I'm perfectly OK with that.\\nAnd we'll obviously try to do better, but we're targeting top-line growth, as our objective, not -- we think the margin improvement is really an output of the business versus the specific objective of the business.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nThanks for the color.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nHey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of things here. You gave us a little granularity on what you're seeing from Aetna.\\nAnd just what do you think in terms of when this comes back? Is this just like a three-, six-, nine-month delay? Or does this take patients out of the funnel? Or does it come back at some point in time? How should we think about just Aetna going forward?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I'm going to answer this and bring in Rob Fletcher as well to add color. What's unknowable for us is, is a patient -- is an Aetna Shockwave patient that got treated today somebody who would have been treated four months ago, two months ago, one month ago? Don't know. It's impossible for us to have that level of granularity.\\nAnd maybe Rob can talk a bit more about sort of what he's seeing more broadly on -- from our team and from societies on this prior auth.\\nRob Fletcher -- Senior Vice President, Marketing and Market Access\\nYeah, that's right, Bill. I think what typically happens after a change in practice from one of the payers that are out there is what you see is at the provider level, at the hospital level, there's often a reaction to that. They have to do more documentation, or they have to take additional measures or steps or allow for more time to go through a prior authorization process. So, typically, what we see is over time after some initial sort of temporal disruption, people figure out how to start working within this and then they plan for it.\\nAnd then it kind of becomes -- back to a steady state. It's kind of a new normal, but you wind up with more of a steady state type of effect. And I think that's what we're seeing and hearing now from customers is that that has really sort of stabilized. People have figured out how to work within that.\\nMeanwhile, we do see action being taken from the medical societies, for example, who did, over the course of this period, come together. Jointly, there was multiple medical societies, and did issue an additional letter to Aetna that covered a bunch of different things, including this prior authorization practice. So, you are starting to see some pushback, and I expect that Aetna will take that under consideration under many other things. But for the time being, I think it's -- I'd describe it as what appears to be more a stable situation at a new normal.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then as a follow-up, I don't want to leave Renee out on our first conference call. Welcome, Renee. Is -- your other income was significant in the quarter, well above.\\nCan you kind of call out any one-times there for us?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWouldn't necessarily be one-time, but certainly, interest income is within that number and then, of course, our interest expense out on the convertible debt. So, that number is going to be nice, given interest rates currently. And thank you for the question.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nSo, $15.3 million, is that something we should model in going forward?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\n$15.3 million might be a little high. There's probably some FX in there. Yeah. So, it's slightly high, but there's -- just because of the FX for the period, but it is largely interest income.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nAmazing. Thank you. Maybe just to hop off on that point. The amount of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, you're approaching $1 billion, so it's nearly as much as is in my checking account.\\nAnd so, I got to ask like what do you like -- updated thoughts? I know there was like a willingness to be sort of strategically footed around M&A., so obviously, it's like nearly an eighth of your market cap. How are you thinking about capital allocation?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd if you want to Venmo me, Patrick, I'm receptive. I'll give you my numbers. So, yes, we continue to be very receptive to smart strategic external opportunities. Maybe emphasis on smart or trying to be smart, at least.\\nWe raised the convert with the -- recognizing that there was a window where valuations for private companies were down, and they still are. It's very hard to raise money for small companies. And valuations have said private companies were -- and willingness of boards sort of had changed over a 12-, 24-month period. And we didn't -- at middle of last year, we did not have the cash wherewithal to make offers on some -- on properties that we might be interested or thought we might be interested in, and we realized that the convert structure and terms were just so attractive that having a 1% coupon in a period where we can -- we're netting a nice interest income relative to our interest expense right now.\\nAnd we didn't raise the money so that we could invest the money, we raised the money so that we could be opportunistic if something came along. That said, the worst thing you could do is just because you have cash, run out and buy something that is not smart to buy. And so, if at the end of the day, we don't see anything that we think is going to be accretive to our growth and accretive to our shareholder value, then we'll sit on the cash until we find something that is worth investing in. That gives us tremendous amount of strategic flexibility that we're -- we feel really fortunate to have for a company at our stage, to be growing at our rate, to be profitable and have this much cash on the books is really -- we recognize the unique position we're in.\\nBut we don't feel obligated to run out and spend that money on something because then we would be more likely to do something that wasn't smart.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nTotally. And maybe as a quick follow-up, the -- slightly more bigger picture, and I know we don't talk about OUS that much, but when do you think you're going to get to a point of a body of clinical evidence that can kind of help unlock some of the penetration in some of the other markets? Obviously, Germany went your way recently, and I know in the U.K., nice sort of reformulated that language around peripheral. But just kind of -- is there like a critical mass of evidence that you feel is needed to unlock the markets? Or is it something else?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nI'll take a shot at that. I think in many of the markets, it's unlikely that at least with our coronary and our peripheral IVL that will amass enough evidence that those systems, kind of the National Health Systems will increase or give extra payment for IVL. I think it's -- those are generally going to need to be large, randomized studies, showing cost effectiveness compared to other products. And we just don't see those studies being necessary, really, one, but also, we're not -- we talked about this a lot internally.\\nWe don't know what to randomize against. Because we don't -- randomizing against the balloon, we don't think is an appropriate study, randomizing against atherectomy, we don't think it's an appropriate study. There are different tools for different clinical situations. So, we're working on it.\\nWe have -- Japan, we're in a good spot. Obviously, Germany, we're in a good spot. Hopefully continue to get better. Our JV is working on regional reimbursement in China, and we'll make progress there.\\nBut I think generally, it's going to be -- IVL is going to be paid for out of kind of hospital funds and the budgets they have to treat to treat patients without any incremental payment for IVL.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWhat will be interesting to see is with COSIRA-II, assuming success in that study, that's exactly the kind of study that the sham-controlled randomized study, again, assuming it works, it will be undeniable that that product does what it was designed to do and actually increases the chances that Reducer could be -- could get reimbursement in some of those systems. And it's a stand-alone procedure versus IVL that drops into existing procedures that are already paid for, so it's harder outside of certain discrete markets like Germany and Japan and the U.S., it's harder to get an incremental payment in those systems because they're kind of not structured to pay more per device, whereas a small subset of countries do pay differentially based on the way they code for different device utilization.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nTotally get it. Thanks so much for taking the questions.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYou're welcome.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHey, thanks for taking the question, and welcome, Renee. Doug, maybe a little bit more color on what modest peripheral growth means. Is that still in the 10% to 15% range? Or is it more low single digits? And is that modest growth every quarter of the year?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nMore modest early. So, low -- we think probably low singles for the first half of the year, stepping up to probably low doubles to teens in the back half of the year.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nOK. Helpful. And then in Q1 -- or sorry, just like in January and February so far, anything to call out on trends in coronary and peripheral? And I'm curious if the total revenue for Q1's still picking up sequentially a little bit.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, on the latter, up a bit sequentially. It was a strong fourth quarter, obviously. We were pleased with the fourth quarter. We're relieved -- not surprised but encouraged that the contagion fear was not realized.\\nWe weren't afraid of contagion from Aetna, but I know a lot of folks who are probably listening to this call we were a little worried that it was going to be multiple payers were going to do what Aetna was doing, and we certainly aren't seeing that. I'd say procedure volumes appear sound. We're not -- we're pleased with what we're hearing from the field.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nOK, great. Thanks a lot for the questions.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYep.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Starting, Doug, in the U.S., U.S. coronary accelerated in Q4.\\nHow much do you think the new DRGs are helping already? And on peripheral, sales were flattish sequentially. Aetna is only 10% to 12% of covered lives, I believe. U.S. peripheral was a growth driver for you.\\nSo, help us understand how Aetna has had so much of an impact? And I had one follow-up.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Aetna was the phenomenon that was the real change that we noted after the sort of mid -- it really took place in September, so end of Q3. carried through into Q4. And when we first -- when we did our call last year, I don't know that we described the underlying sort of slowness of procedures that we were seeing in the third quarter into the fourth quarter for peripheral.\\nSo, it would have been -- we would have been a little soft on peripheral, and then you compounded that with Aetna. I'd say, on balance, peripheral procedures appear to be somewhat less soft, but it's -- so I think we feel more bullish about growth, particularly as we turn focus back to peripheral. Right now, we're -- for good reason, with two reimbursement changes, a new product launch, we really want to maximize on our coronary opportunity. And then when we have three product launches in a row in peripheral we'll be spending a lot of time on peripheral.\\nSo, we're anticipating peripheral will contribute much more nicely to growth end of '24 into '25, and high hopes for JAVELIN to be a major contributor to that end as well. So, we're -- you're not wrong. Aetna is a 10% to 20% player on the -- in the matrix of all the private payers. So, it wasn't just an Aetna phenomenon, but Aetna, clearly, was a meaningful -- had a meaningful impact, but it wasn't the entirety of the impact on the peripheral volume in the back end of last year.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nAnd Doug, sorry, the first part of the question was the acceleration in U.S. coronary. Was this -- the strength in the quarter came from U.S. coronary.\\nHave you started to see an impact from the new DRGs already? And I'll ask my follow-up, Doug. There's a late breaker at ACC on Neovasc this ORBITA-COSMIC. How is it different from COSIRA-II? And is there any read-through from that trial to what we might see in COSIRA-II? Thank you.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's really hard to -- well, generally, as we say consistently on reimbursement because it's what we've observed, it's a dimmer switch not an on and off switch, so it has an effect gradually over time. And we launched C2+ and we got the uplift simultaneously. It certainly doesn't -- it did not hurt at all. It will always be impossible to disaggregate new product launch and reimbursement that happened simultaneously, and it's now going to be even harder because now we've got the CPT goods.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nYeah. I'll just pile on to that, Larry. What we talked about in the past, what the inpatient -- I think especially the inpatient uplift in the DRG, what it does ultimately is as the hospitals see the income coming in, it helps the cath lab budget get relaxed. And so, the cath lab then puts less pressure on physicians to moderate their use.\\nThey can -- physicians then feel like they use IVL when it's appropriate and they're not getting pushback from cath lab administrators. And that takes time. I was at an account earlier this week in Santa Cruz, and that was the input from them. They just don't -- they're not getting push back from the administration anymore.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd on ORBITA-COSMIC, we certainly are delighted to see multiple data sets for Reducer at ACC. That's encouraging. We don't know the results from that study. It's small, 50-ish patients, so it's not going to be powered to make any conclusions about it.\\nThey use MRI as an endpoint, so really unclear if that's a -- I see that as a feasibility of that tool versus something that's going to be just positive about the Reducer. I won't be surprised if you see that patients' symptoms are better because that's what we see consistently in the various studies that have been done on Reducer and what we see anecdotally from all the users in Europe. Whether you really learn anything, that is a read-through to COSIRA-II because we don't use MRI as an endpoint in COSIRA-II, so I don't know that that's going to really be informative on potential outcome of the COSIRA-II study. If the patients feel better in the treatment arm, that bodes well for COSIRA-II, I guess, could be the one takeaway.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask on the outpatient coronary reimbursement topic with an eye toward the map to 5194. Kind of two-parter.\\nThe event path from here, and then a question on coding. So, is this event path simply we wake up in July, we see the proposal and we see what we see? Or do you have an opportunity to engage with CMS here through this spring that might give you a better feel for how they're looking at this? And the second piece is on coding. I think we're operating under the assumption that this winds up getting solved with the complexity adjustment using the new CPT code that was in effect Jan 1, '24. Is that correct? Or is there potentially another to-be-determined coating solution here?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. It would be a waste if I try to answer this one. Rob's sitting right next to me, so I'll let Rob take this one.\\nRob Fletcher -- Senior Vice President, Marketing and Market Access\\nYeah. I think the -- so as part of normal course of business, we do get on CMS' calendar as they start to make -- they get into their rule-making cycle. And so, certainly, we have met with CMS, again, about this issue and the issue of the transitional pass-through and so on and so forth. So, I think your first question was what's the normal course of business and the sort of things that happen.\\nAnd the first thing that happens is that you sort of talk with CMS prior to them making the rule, drafting the rule, about your issue at hand. And so, that's happened. I think the things that we see from here, yes, I would mainly point the next sort of public available information is likely going to be the proposed rule, which happens in early July. So, we won't sort of see or hear much in the public domain between now and then.\\nSo, hopefully, Mike, that got that part of the question. I think your second part of the question, or your second question, was just around the mechanism that would proceed here. And I think you've identified it correctly that here, what we're talking about as a complexity adjustment that's based on an add-on code, a procedure add-on code, and that's the normal vehicle by which if you have an add-on code in structure, that's how you get increased payment, is then you then sort of qualify -- certain combinations of code qualify for complexity adjustment, and that's exactly sort of what we're looking at here. And as for on this call and others, this is where we have a very large volume of data associated with that.\\nWe have sort of strong confidence in these combinations of codes and then qualifying for complexity adjustment.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nThat was a great, Rob, on both fronts. And the brief follow-up is maybe back to Doug. I think, Doug, on several instances, you've suggested maybe 95% confidence in the outcome here of kind of achieving 5194 in 2025 and beyond. Is 95% still how you feel about this?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nI do not feel less confident. I wish CMS, when Rob met with them, said, you're right, we're going to do it. But they don't say those things. They just look blankly at Rob.\\nAnd every time we meet, and usually, we get a good outcome. And this time, I think the facts are pretty clearly pointing in the direction of moving to 5194.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nHelpful. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions, and welcome, Renee. You called out 2% penetration in Germany. Can you just give us a sense of where you are in terms of penetration within key accounts? And what have you seen in terms of how utilization has scaled early on, and what procedure volumes look like in some of the top accounts?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. We have -- I think even in the top accounts in Germany, the penetration is still relatively low. What happens in Germany when there isn't sufficient payment to cover the cost of a product, there's a very tight linkage between the hospital administration and the physician's behavior in Germany, tighter than I think anywhere else except Japan. So, what happens is the physicians will use the product until the administration tells them to stop and then they stop.\\nSo, you'd get the cyclical -- an account using the product, and then it would just turn off in September. Or they'd use the product and then the administration will come back the next year and say, \\\"Hey, you used 50, you only get 25 this year.\\\" And so, the product utilization will get curtailed. And then at smaller accounts, it would essentially be zero because they just didn't have enough money within the hospital system to cover these extra costs and the administration would clamp down. So, we really have a lot of headroom in Germany, not just gaining adoption in smaller accounts, which is kind of a zero base in those accounts but then really driving appropriate use and adoption at the larger accounts where it was being curtailed by the administration.\\nDoes that answer your question?\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nYeah, it's perfect. I mean, just one separate follow-up. It looks like on COSIRA-II, the CT.gov is giving you a primary completion date of June 2024, but I just wanted to double check on how we should think about the timing there and when we could see those results.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, we need to update that.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nI don't think we've touched that since the acquisition, so that was not a realistic timeline ever.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. That was the prior company's timeline. Yes. Right now, if you recall, we're forecasting approval in '27.\\nYou got to back up from there for submission and review of a PMA, and then that puts your enrollment completion somewhere second half of '25 is a much more realistic timeline. And the team is doing a really exceptional job of getting sites up. There was a paucity of sites that had been started, and many of those sites weren't really probably the right sites to choose to get rapid enrollment. So, our team, once they took over, have gotten the trial on the rails, but it's a sham-controlled trial with a really rigorous enrollment criteria, inclusion criteria, which is why every time we show clinicians the trial design, they universally say if, and we would say when, when that study is successful, it's -- it will be irrefutable that that device works.\\nSo, rigorous trial makes it hard to enroll. A rigorous trial also results in much more valuable data for market creation and -- inclusive of reimbursement.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nThat's super helpful. Thanks very much.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nYeah, thanks. Just a couple on the new peripheral products, so E8 and JAVELIN. I can't remember if you had said anything about the pricing on those products at the Investor Day you did in the fall, but can you give us any sense there on where those things would be priced? And then with JAVELIN, I mean, am I thinking about it the right way that that's something that could drive more revenue per procedure, because they would likely use that to kind of cross a lesion and then you follow that up with one of the regular catheter -- or sorry, balloons?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nIf we said anything about price, it would have been something along the lines of we will determine the price when we get closer to launching the product, and that would still be what I would say now. Thus far, we try to make sure that we deliver really clinically meaningful new devices to our customers and price them in a way that we think is -- enables the customers to have a good financial outcome and for us to reflect the value of the technology. In terms of JAVELIN, there likely will be some cases where you use JAVELIN plus, JAVELIN plus E8, JAVELIN plus M5+, but we -- what we've witnessed thus far is that the power of the lithotripsy shock waves is not just cracking in a sort of forward effect to get you through the difficult to cross lesions, but it also has a radial effect, which enables you to then follow JAVELIN with standard balloon angioplasty. And so, our expectation is that the vast majority of cases will be JAVELIN plus POBA versus JAVELIN plus another IVL product.\\nAt some juncture, you start to get yourself in a challenging situation with your customers if you load too many IVL products into a single procedure. It just becomes less economically attractive for them. So, we're -- our expectation is that, for the most part, JAVELIN is going to be a JAVELIN plus other, JAVELIN plus balloon.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nOK. That makes sense. And then just as far as Costa Rica goes, I understand that there's some kind of start-up costs and whatnot in the near term, but is that something that you expect to have a material benefit to your gross margins over time?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have chosen to date to manufacture in one of the highest cost places in America, in Santa Clara. So, we do expect that our cost of goods will come down in Costa Rica. So, we've not forecast how many points will pick up out of Costa Rica, but cost of doing business there in every respect is going to be lower than -- other than materials cost, is going to be lower in every respect than what we have right now in Santa Clara.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nYeah. Just important to remember, though, that for 2024, the product we sell will be manufactured in Santa Clara, so we won't see any benefit to gross margin in 2024.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. We'll put product into inventory this year, but it won't hit customers until '25.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nYeah, I understand. So, there'll definitely be a benefit yet to be quantified, I guess, for '25 and beyond.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nDo you agree?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nCorrect. Yeah. I would certainly expect gross margins to be steady for this year. And then in the long run, we will see an improvement given the structure set up.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nOK, great. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First, on Japan, I'm wondering if you can just sort of give us any sort of metrics on where you are in that launch in terms of what percentage of the 1,200 or so cath labs there that you're in now at this stage of the launch?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. So, the -- again, very, very good year for the team in Japan. It's a relatively small team, and they were incredibly productive in 2023. Based on the guidelines that we worked with, that Shockwave worked with CVIT, the cardiovascular society in Japan, to establish, we are currently limited to hospitals that do a certain number of atherectomy procedures.\\nSo, those tend to be larger hospitals, obviously, with surgical backup. There's also some limitations on, because of the way the trial data we have, we don't have trial data of Shockwave followed by de novo DCB, and de novo DCB is approved in Japan. We don't have trial data of Shockwave after atherectomy, Rota-Shock, for instance. So, part of the work we're doing, it started last year, and we'll be going on in earnest this year and the following years, is to create clinical data to support the use of Shockwave with de novo DCB, to support the use of Rota-Shock, Shockwave with atherectomy.\\nAnd then as we gather more and more data, work with CVIT to show that the product can be safely used in smaller centers, in centers without surgical backup. And as you'll recall, we have that kind of stamp of approval in the U.S. from SCAI already. So, there is -- there's basically a certain number of centers that we have agreed with CVIT that we cannot access until we generate more data, and we're generating those data now.\\nSo, with the centers that we really can access, which account for probably 75% of the PCI in Japan, we're over 50% launched. Or sorry, we've launched over 50% of those centers, and we'll launch the remaining ones in 2024.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And what about the peripheral IVL side in Japan? What's the latest timeline there?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nWe haven't disclosed the timeline yet. We're working right now with the PMDA to establish the regulatory path, and then once that's done kind of first half of this year, we hope to have the path established, then we'll start lining out the timing and the -- or the steps and the timing to get there. And at some point, we'll tell you what that is.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And then one more international question on India. Obviously, a massive PCI market. Can you just remind us where you are there at this stage and how you're thinking about that opportunity over the next few years?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. We have a distributor in India. We established the distributor in 2020. We launched coincident with coronavirus in February 2020, so the -- as that country has kind of gone through some ups and downs like the rest of the world, we've gotten a good footprint in India through a distributor.\\nWe've generated really nice post-market data in India, post-market registry over 1,000 patients, all comers, core lab adjudicated. Those were presented at -- those data were presented at TCT last fall, and we continue to have really nice momentum, particularly on coronary in India.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And then just one very quick pipeline question. Have you guys started human cases with the aortic lithotripsy product yet?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have not. No.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nAny estimated timeline on that?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThis year.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nThis year. OK, perfect. OK. Thank you very much.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYep.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy. Please proceed with your question.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end to the year.\\nDoug, I was going to ask about C2+. How are you seeing that being adopted? I know it's early days. You said feedback has been good, but are you seeing it motivate more physicians to pick up IVL and do vessel prep in their patients? Or is it right now more about existing users, treating more patients, and accessing those tougher to treat patients?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I'd say it's more adoption existing users versus new users. And that's -- and more adoption is going to be the -- with all of the different tailwinds we have, reimbursement and technology tailwinds followed by another technology upgrade next year, it's really finding ways to help people who use -- shift from 4% to 10% and from 10% to 20%, helping give them a good reason to use Shockwave more than they already do. Those who don't use the device yet are in the minority and less of a -- sort of much less opportunity for us to drive growth with, because they're probably also pretty low-volume operators.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nOK. And that was kind of my -- one of my follow-up questions. You already touched on it, on existing users who both do IVL, and all of the patients previously know that there is a large number of patients that have severe disease and treating all of them, so they aren't picking a party to use. Why are they --\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nSo, your phone made it tricky to interpret your question, but I'm going to -- I'll restate your question as best I can, and you tell me if I'm wrong. So, what is the impediment to increase use of IVL or physicians?\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nSorry about that.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo, that's OK. It just makes it a little more challenging. So, the biggest reason historically has been, a, is the economic concern. We have a premium device that we priced at a level that we thought both reflected the value and would ultimately lead to a strong reimbursement position that would be beneficial to the hospital.\\nThankfully, the work Rob and team did was successful. We were successful in securing our own DRGs, which were shocking, on the coronary side, CPT code, and we think ultimately will also yield sort of landing in the highest APC level for coronaries. But the initial reaction to the price was, oh, this is a high-priced device, and there was a lot of anxiety with TPT. That's a little unusual in terms of a reimbursement mechanism, and so there's always been a perception among physicians that we're not really reimbursed even though we have been.\\nSo, there's always been a reluctance in many physicians' hands and minds to -- like I'll only use Shockwave when I absolutely have to because it's an expensive device. So, now that the first two of the three building blocks for eliminating that economic anxiety with the DRGs and CPT code are in place, we think this year will be the first year where a lot of that economic anxiety is ameliorated. The second, another reason why they have been reluctant historically is I've got this long diffuse lesion. You're going to -- I'm going to have to pull two catheters to treat it.\\nMaybe I'll just use atherectomy instead of Shockwave. C2+ addresses that long diffuse reluctance. It also helps diffuse the sort of misperception that Shockwave is less effective on eccentric or nodular calcium. So, now, we give you more power, you can treat those eccentric lesions with one catheter.\\nSo, those are really two of the big headwinds we had faced, the biggest being the economics. And then ultimately, the -- I think the last -- one of the sort of next hurdles that we'll knock down is the our device is very deliverable, but it's not as deliverable as physicians would like. So, there are times when they choose not to pull it because it's bulkier than a regular angioplasty balloon. So, I'll just use something else.\\nThat's a 2025 fix that we'll have with Arrow. So, we've got -- each year, we'll be knocking down the remaining -- some of the remaining pressure points that have capped utilization, and we think we'll just keep uncapping utilization each year.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nThank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThere are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to Doug Godshall for closing remarks.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks so much, and thanks, everybody, for your time and attention. Looking forward to another great year in 2024 and delighted to have Renee on board. Look forward to chatting with you all as the year progresses.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the DexCom fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. My name is Abby, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.\\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Sean Christensen, vice president of finance and investor relations.

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin. \\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2023 was an incredible year for DexCom, and I'd like to start by reviewing some of our key accomplishments. Total revenue grew by 24% on an organic basis, driven by another year of record customer starts. This translates into more than $700 million of organic revenue growth compared to last year, as we built strong commercial momentum through recent coverage expansion and the performance of DexCom's CGM systems.\\nIn 2023, we added over 600,000 DexCom users to our base and ended the year with approximately 2.3 million customers globally. Importantly, we delivered this level of growth again while enhancing scale and efficiency of our operations. A key milestone here was the opening of our Malaysia manufacturing facility around midyear. Production at this site is ramping quickly, and the team is already delivering yields on par with our more established U.S.\\nfacilities. This facility will help support our growth and cost ambitions for years to come. As a measure of our success for 2023, we not only generated $1 billion in Q4 revenue, we also delivered $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the year and generated record levels of free cash flow, which is up nearly 70% compared to 2022. By establishing a disciplined cost culture that focuses years in advance, we are striking the right balance of margin progression, while still investing strategically in pathways to support our significant growth opportunities.\\nFrom a strategic perspective, 2023 will go down as one of the most transformational years in our company's history. We launched G7 and Dexcom ONE into multiple new markets significantly expanding our global access and advancing key technical and clinical work that will provide the foundation for the future of DexCom. This started with the rollout of G7 in the U.S. in February.\\nG7 is the most accurate CGM ever launched and the market's reception to G7 has been exceptional. Customers and clinicians have been thrilled with the new form factor, product performance, and ease of use and payers wasted no time establishing coverage as they recognize the clear value proposition that G7 provides. We immediately started to see a change in prescribing patterns once this product reached the market. And this trend became even more pronounced as we completed the largest expansion of coverage in our company's history.\\nIn mid-April, Medicare coverage went live for people with type 2 diabetes, using basal insulin only, as well as certain non-insulin-using individuals with hypoglycemia risk. Between this decision and the broad commercial coverage that quickly followed for the basal markets, we have effectively doubled our reimbursed population in the U.S. This has completely changed the market landscape in the U.S. With broader coverage available and a new product that greatly simplifies the prescribing process, we've attracted a sizable new cohort of clinicians to our ecosystem.\\nIn fact, in 2023, we expanded our prescriber base by approximately 40%, and we're not stopping there. We have always known that the primary care channel would become increasingly important as our business evolves. Much of the work our commercial team has done in recent years has been tailored to this market. And we are now seeing the direct result of that effort as more than 70% of our new scripts are being written by primary care physicians.\\nThese relationships are not only critical to help us reach the millions of insulin-using individuals who have not yet started on CGM but also the tens of millions with broader type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and beyond. Based on the success of our team in 2023 and the magnitude of these future opportunities, we are excited to continue our investment in our U.S. sales force this year. When we have a presence with prescribers, we win.\\nNow, it is up to us to continue to expand that prescriber pool. We are already seeing more clinicians want to incorporate Dexcom CGM earlier into patients' care plans as they recognize our unique ability to drive behavior change, sustainable outcomes, and greater accountability. This is why we are thrilled to be introducing our newest product, Stelo, later this summer. Stelo will be the first CGM designed specifically for people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin.\\nLeveraging our leading sensor platform, we have built a custom software experience that is tailored to the needs of this population. Stelo will feature a 15-day wear time and launches a cash pay product while we build our case with payers for broader coverage. With several trials currently underway, we will continue to add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating DexCom's unique ability to drive greater health and economic outcomes for all people with diabetes. The launch of Stelo also presents a great opportunity to bolster our evidence with a large collection of real-world data as we see the impact this product is having on our customers.\\nWe filed Stelo with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, leaving us well on track for our highly anticipated launch this summer. As our product portfolio continues to grow, it provides a greater glimpse into the future potential of our company. We have built a platform technology that we can customize to provide creative solutions for different populations. Our redesigned software infrastructure is a key component to this, as it enables much quicker iteration and greater connectivity.\\nConnectivity has always been a distinct advantage for DexCom. And with our recent filing of direct-to-watch with the FDA and new G7 pump integrations, we are further advancing this leadership position. We will also continue innovating on our hardware technology, with our current efforts focused on launching an extended wear sensor across all of our product offerings. As we look at the significant opportunity ahead of us, we are as excited as we've ever been.\\nAs I said at our Investor Day this past summer, we are just getting started. With that, I will now turn it over to Jereme for a review of the fourth-quarter financials. Jereme?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.035 billion, compared to $815 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis.\\nAs a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $769 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $606 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27%. Between the ongoing success of G7 and our significantly improved access in recent months, the momentum in our U.S.\\nbusiness continues to grow. In fact, we delivered our fastest quarterly U.S. growth rate since the beginning of 2021 as our revenue accelerated for the third quarter in a row. International revenue grew 27%, totaling $265 million in the fourth quarter.\\nInternational organic revenue growth was 23% for the fourth quarter. We continue to execute very well across our international footprint and again took share in Q4 as our global access work and product portfolio strategy have helped broaden our reach in many markets. Our fourth-quarter gross profit was $664 million or 64.2% of revenue, compared to 66.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year decline in gross margin was expected as G7 was a much larger percent of our product and customer mix in Q4, compared to a year ago.\\nAs a reminder, G7 has a higher cost profile than G6 today but we expect this to change in the coming quarters as we drive greater volume through our G7 lines. As it reaches scale, we continue to expect G7's margin profile to improve upon that of our G6 platform. Operating expenses were $421 million for Q4 2023, compared to $372 million in Q4 of 2022. This quarter was another demonstration of our commitment to being disciplined and thoughtful with our spend.\\nOur operating expenses grew at half the rate of revenue this quarter, and we delivered nearly 500 basis points of operating expense leverage compared to last year. This extended our streak to eight straight quarters of at least 250 basis points of year-over-year opex leverage. Operating income was $242.7 million or 23.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $172.1 million or 21.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million or 31.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $237.1 million or 29.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nNet income for the third quarter was $202.8 million or $0.50 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the year with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Having financial flexibility allows the organization to take advantage of opportunities. Case in point, we executed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program mentioned on our Q3 results.\\nThrough this transaction, we were able to offset the remaining dilution related to our maturing 2023 converts, while purchasing our stock at what we view as an attractive price. As Kevin mentioned earlier, our free cash flow grew by 70% in 2023 as our business continues to scale and become more efficient. As our cash flow profile continues to grow, it only adds to our significant financial flexibility. This allows us to continue to invest behind our meaningful organic growth opportunity while assessing strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis.\\nTurning to 2024 guidance. As we stated last month, we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.35 billion, representing organic growth of 16% to 21% for the year. This guidance assumes continued momentum in the type 2 basal-only population in the U.S., the expansion of Dexcom ONE on the G7 platform into new geographies, and the launch of Stelo in the summer of 2024. It also assumes the divestiture of our non-diabetes distribution business in Australia and New Zealand this quarter, which represented around $30 million of revenue in 2023.\\nFrom a margin perspective, we expect full-year non-GAAP gross profit margin to be in a range of 63% to 64%. Operating profit margin to be approximately 20% and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 29%. Our gross margin guidance reflects the ongoing conversion from G6 to G7 within our customer base and the associated scale that comes with that process. Below gross margin, we'll continue to be very diligent with our spend in 2024, while investing strategically behind multiple growth opportunities.\\nWith that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\\nSean Christensen -- Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then reenter the queue if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you. Well now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. I'll offer up for the second time congrats on a really good quarter. I wanted to tie two ideas together. The first is the great operating margins we saw in the fourth quarter, came in well above the street.\\nAnd in the slide deck presentation, you have the slide about making progress on the 15-day sensor. And the question here is really, one, any updates on the time frame of when that G-Series 15-day sensor will be approved? And how to really think about where that could take the good operating margins you put up here and what you've guided for next year and where that could really take it in the future? Thanks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Robbie. This is Kevin. I'll take the 15-day sensor timing, and then Jereme can talk about the numbers and the effect on operating margins going forward. As we've said earlier this year, we're in the middle of clinical testing and scientific evaluation of some fundamental science changes to the sensor, that will make it more reliable for that 15-day period.\\nOne of the reasons that we've done so well, two things: the accuracy of our sensor and the performance of our sensor over time but combined with the fact people expect to get a certain amount of days from a sensor and we deliver what we tell them we're going to do. And we want to make sure that 15-day experience is every bit as good as the 10-day experience that we offer now. So, we're making a few slight changes on a science basis. We'll run a clinical study, file that, and we certainly would expect to get approved.\\nBut right now, we're still evaluating some of the technologies. And we really won't provide a lot of color until we're filed, and we see we're on a path toward approval.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. And then to your question longer term on operating margins, we've done a really nice job to date, creating leverage and opportunities within our operating margin profile. And despite some of the moves in the channel mix changes we've made on the top line, we've been able to maintain a gross margin, based on a lot of the work we've done around design to value and a lot of the scale that we've been able to achieve. But when you think about 15-day, it provides a real big opportunity for us to think about both leverage from a gross margin and then operating margin profile, but also opportunities to grow the business in areas profitably that maybe it would be a little bit more of a challenge with the 10-day product.\\nSo, it is absolutely the No. 1 effort going on in the organization. It does provide us lots of flexibility to either, a, continue to grow the business; or b, deliver operating margins that can be world-class over time. So, I think longer term, there's a lot of opportunities there.\\nWe're not ready to particularly lay out what that is. We've obviously given our 2025 LRP. And we'll execute to that, but I do think it provides real long-term opportunities for this company to deliver back to shareholders and take advantage of opportunities globally.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong end to the year.\\nIt's great to see. I'm going to ask this question about -- we're hearing more about potential competition coming to market. And I would just love, Kevin, if maybe you could highlight for us the competitive moats that DexCom has built. Obviously, we don't know much about what this competitor is planning to bring to market.\\nBut maybe if you could just highlight where you think DexCom is from a competition perspective and how defensible your share is here. Thanks so much.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, I appreciate that question. First and foremost, we can start with the core technology and the fundamental beliefs we've had here as a company. The performance of our centers has been unparalleled. We've got over 1 million years, for example, and AID systems with great outcomes and patients who have done very well there.\\nWe've built our platforms on connectivity. One of the features that I've talked with the engineers about and kind of complained about because it took a lot of time to engineer. We can connect up to three devices at the same time. This is the type of connectivity that our competitors have not put into their platforms, and it's a feature that's very important to our patients, which is the reason, for example, why we just filed our direct-to-watch features with the FDA.\\nOne of the other things our competition thinks about as they look at us today, and they think this is where we're going to stay. We're not. We certainly have new pipeline efforts across all fronts on the technology side, better connectivity communications, software investments. We've had to evolve from being literally a medical device software company to being a world-class software organization over the past couple of years.\\nAnd it has been an evolution for us and it's been a big investment. So, we've looked at the areas to invest to make ourselves stronger and made investments there. Now, that's on the technology side. Here's the other piece of this.\\nWe've spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years, getting fully automated factories up and running both here in the United States and our new factory in Malaysia that opened midyear, and that is a tremendous facility. But we built out those automated lines there, and we just turned ground on what will be our next world-class factory over in Ireland that would open in 2026. There's a huge investment that has to be made to play in the CGM business going forward, particularly at the scale and the performance that we see now. And we've made those investments and done those things and evolved as a company.\\nSo, we think we're very well positioned, and we'll see where everybody else comes. But we're comfortable. Well, let me rephrase that, we're never comfortable. But we believe we've done all the right things.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Yeah. I wanted to focus on Stelo.\\nYou expect this product to add approximately, I think, 100 basis points to your growth in '24, which is almost $40 million in six months. So, that's a pretty healthy number for only half a year. Kevin, what's informing your confidence in the launch? How big could this product be over time? And what are the margin implications? Thank you.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nLarry, thanks for the question. And we have guided at 1%. The purpose of this launch is to get this product out here and learn. And as we look at that 1% of revenue number, we certainly have models that build and support that.\\nAnd we believe in designing this product for the type 2 non-insulin user and others that we're targeting the right segment to go after that. Our most important experience with Stelo is learning and getting it out there and starting to develop and grow this new market. We're confident that this product over time can become a very, very large portion of our business, and this can be a very large segment within our markets. This year's launch is all about learning more than anything else.\\nAnd we have a model for that 1%. I would love to exceed it. But if we learn all the lessons that we need to learn, this is not a backbreaker for our company and our guidance either. So, the most important thing is to get the product out there and to learn more than anything else.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. And then to your question on margin, we're not necessarily talking about it from a gross margin perspective. That will come in time, when we start to release more details around it, Larry. From an operating margin, yes, this is something we're going to invest in.\\nAnd so, when you think about it from an overall company margins, certainly, as we invest in this and we invest in launching it, there will be some sales and marketing, but it's an investment we're going to make this year. And we're going to make that investment in this product because we believe in the future, and we're going to do so and still expand operating margins as a company. So, you can be safe that we're going to be very, very careful and measured about how we invest our dollars, but know that this is part of the investments we've set aside as an organization while still, again, improving profitability.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open.\\nMathew Blackman -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate you taking my question. Maybe for Kevin and Jereme, you obviously mentioned sales force and the PCP channel. Can you just remind us, at least today, what kind of PCP sales force coverage you have? And then more importantly, sort of leaning into your comments, Kevin, about investing, seemingly incrementally in that channel this year.\\nWhat does that mean in terms of spend magnitude, spend timing? And how much more coverage are you expecting to add with these investments or any other way to frame what you're trying to accomplish? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, thanks for the question, Matt. So, when you think about the investment, we are going to expand that sales force. And today, we have a good amount of coverage.\\nIt's tens of thousands of primary care physicians and predominantly the entirety of the endocrinologist space. But as you start to think about basal coverage expanding, the opportunity ahead of us certainly Stelo out on the horizon, we found there was an opportunity to continue to expand. And as we know, CGM, specifically Dexcom CGM, can play a very important role in how folks manage their diabetes. We know that having those call points is helpful.\\nSo, we are going to expand, and you can take a look at LinkedIn for the amount. There's quite a few openings out there, in terms of the size of it. So, we'll expand our sales force, and we will get more coverage. In terms of the cadence, the LinkedIn -- recs are out there right now, so you'll see us hire over the course of the first quarter.\\nObviously, then the fully loaded burden associated with those reps will take place over the back half of the year, so Q2 through Q4. So, that's how to think about the cadence of that. But again, that's all contemplated in the overall guidance we've provided, the 20% operating margin. So, expect it as part of typical work that we do around creating leverage in the business and investing where we need to.\\nBut if you're thinking about it for a cadence over the course of the year, expect the hires to be made over the course of the first quarter. And then for folks to ramp up and be part of our run rate really Q2, through the balance of the year.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question here on international.\\nI think you've reminded us that you'll be selling a non-CGM business in Australia and also going direct in Japan. I wanted to understand the cadence for Q1 versus the rest of the year. And also, any sort of comments you could make on G7, being on the Dexcom ONE platform? Just an all-around international question there.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks, Marie. And we'll give you some context. So, the non-CGM business, that effectively is gone at this point.\\nSo, that's why we've been comfortable pulling it out and talking about it to organic. So, this quarter, you can expect -- we talked about $30-ish million last year. The math on that, you can kind of do the allocation by quarter. That's out as of this point, for the most part.\\nAnd so, think about that in the quarter, Japan certainly a similar type thing. We talked about it in Q4 being effectively nil. I'd expect a similar contribution in the first quarter. And then as we start to take that book of business or that business live in the second quarter and expect it to start to contribute, as we build that business back up over the course of the year.\\nSo, those are really the international kind of timing. So, Q1 will be the heaviest burden, in terms of as we transition through that. As it pertains to Dexcom ONE on G7, great news is, I think we press released it a couple of days ago, four countries have launched. And so, that has come out.\\nIt is now out there today. Those four countries our first foray, and we're getting great feedback from early adopters within those countries. The expectation is we have a cadence of launches of Dexcom ONE on a G7 form factor, really over the course of the year. So, I'd expect a lot more press releases around where and when we're launching that but expect that to really take place over the course of the year, which gives us a lot of confidence again in Dexcom ONE being a really incredible growth driver for the long term.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.\\nJeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\\nHey, guys, good afternoon. Maybe I'll just keep it on that international point. I think this is the first quarter in a while we've seen international growth below the U.S. growth.\\nAnd if I look back the last few quarters, I think you've gone 40%, 30%, 23% here on the organic growth rate. Just help us understand kind of where that international versus U.S. growth might settle out here in 2024. Would we expect them to be similar to each other? Does International continue to slow for any reason? And as I think about some of the competitive AID approvals that have happened over in Europe, especially with one of your -- with a competitive CGM.\\nJust how are you thinking about the stability of your maybe installed base on the AID side over there versus win rate for new AID systems there? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Hey, thanks, Jeff. So, as you think about the cadence -- so thanks for the question on international. As you think about the cadence over the course of the year, certainly Q4 was buoyed by a few different -- or way down, I guess, I'd say, by a few different things.\\nWe talked a little bit about earlier about the Japan business and really the revenues were effectively nil as we make that transition. And so, that's a negative grower in the quarter. And then the non-diabetes business was really flat. And so, when you think about the business being historically a pretty significant grower, those pull you down.\\nAs you start to exclude those things, we are still growing quite well. In fact, all of the core businesses where we operate today, U.K., Germany, Australia, etc., all continue to grow relatively consistently between Q2, Q3, Q4. There are just some ebbs and flows. But for the most part, those all should do well.\\nSo, then you think about what does that mean going forward? We haven't changed our stance that the OUS business, the international business as a percentage of revenue by the end of 2025 will be bigger than it is today, about two-thirds/one-third, where that split today is more like 70/30 or 72/28. So, I think on the whole, expect the international business with all of the opportunity out there, with certainly the underpenetration we have today, to grow faster than that of the U.S. business over the coming years. That's not to say that we're not incredibly bullish on the U.S.\\nbusiness. Look, if we can outperform on both of those, we'll do the work on both. But at least that's in our LRP. As you think about competitive systems and AID, we are highly confident in what we have to offer.\\nOur product, there's multiple different reasons why we believe our product is special in that space. Kevin alluded to a little bit about it earlier around Bluetooth connectivity is one. I'll just give you an example there. Someone can be on a pump, can talk to their phone, and can be on a direct-to-watch application, all while on our product.\\nNo one else can offer that. We are the only one that can do that. And as you think about this population, which really needs and deserves, quite frankly, the technology to manage their diabetes, we believe that that is a differentiator and a meaningful differentiator going forward. Add to that the millions and millions of years that we're compiling on these systems, we feel highly confident that when we sit in front of a physician, we sit in front of an endocrinologist and we sit in front of a parent, a child that needs an AID system, we feel confident that we are the choice.\\nWe'll continue to battle and make sure that that message continues to go out there. But as we think about that international book of business, we continue to feel very confident even post launch of a competitive system, we'll do incredibly well there.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.\\nMatt Taylor -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could update us on the cadence of data that we could expect to see this year, not only around -- you mentioned before, GLP-1 data that could come from you or from investigators. And then also on Stelo, are we going to see anything on that at upcoming conferences or from you before, during, or after the launch?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo. This is Kevin. I'll take that. We don't really -- we don't need a clinical trial for Stelo as far as getting that product approved.\\nThere is a lot of data on use of continuous glucose monitoring, particularly DexCom systems in this type 2 diabetes world that will be published by investigators over the course of the next several months. And we'll reference to that, and we'll talk to you about that. We know -- we have a very good idea where this data comes out because we've seen in all our studies patients have better outcomes or healthier. We end up saving the system money.\\nAnd those are the outcomes that we're hoping to drive with Stelo over time. With respect to GLP-1s, again, the list of studies ongoing is very large. And there are studies where CGM is an element. Again, we expect those studies when they're published to demonstrate the same things that we've talked about before that the use of the CGM with the GLP-1 provides a better result, than a study without it.\\nAnd those studies we published over time, we don't control those investigators. But we expect good data over the course of the year.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHey, thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to understand a little bit more, Kevin, if you could give some more clarity on how you think of reimbursement pathway for Stelo could look over the next couple of years? What do you think is needed to open reimbursement up for that product and how you think that would look if it would be done in a more traditional way or do you think it could be done kind of more one-off like the Levels program with UnitedHealthcare?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nOur goal is to do this in a more traditional -- for time. As we've said earlier, we'll launch the product as a cash pay product and have a cash pay option, a cash pay that people can get into and purchase the product. We will accumulate data from those users over time. We'll accumulate data again from the clinical trials that we see out there and ultimately build a case for reimbursement for this product.\\nI think over time, we certainly expect to go to CMS and have people with type 2 diabetes, who are on insulin, covered at some point in time by that group because again, our goal is to spend less money in the healthcare system, and we're one of the few technologies that enables an outcome of that nature. So, we see it being more traditional and working with payers and the various government agencies over time. The programs we will continue to support, we're happy to support them and be partners with them. But I think over time, we need to have a more traditional reimbursement path.\\nAnd that can be -- the partnerships and the relationships can be the only way. On top of that, we'll continue to develop our tools around Stelo. This first generation that we launch is going to be our first pass app. We will have numerous iterations over the course of the first 24 months of that product.\\nIt really makes it a much more inviting and engaging product and lead people to better experiences. So, stay tuned for what we have to say on that front over the next 12 months. It's going to be very exciting.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citigroup. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Nice quarter. A couple of questions, two related ones. Can you sort of give us the guidance for tax and how to think about net interest expense? And then the one that strikes me as somewhat more interesting is I think your LRP is for 21% operating margins.\\nAnd this is the second quarter in a row where you've bypassed that number. So, why is 21% still the right number to be had? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Yeah. So, we'll start with tax. I think this year, we kind of dropped down to closer to that 26% range.\\nWhile we don't necessarily guide year by year to tax, the goal is over the course of the next three to five years to get down into the low 20s. So, I would expect it to continue to come down every year as we grow into the tax structure that we've put in place. In terms of net interest income, some of that -- it's one of those -- it's a bit of a difficult one, but just given where interest rate is going to go over time. But it's pretty straightforward that our cash interest cost is pretty low just given our converts.\\nAnd so, you can basically take a look at the cash on the balance sheet, multiply it by about 4%. And that gets you to about where you'd be for the year. Again, we'll have to keep you updated as interest rates change over time. But that's the other way to think about it.\\nAnd then from an operating margin perspective, we gave the 2025 LRP. That's a 21%. Your point is valid. If you take a look at our guide this year at 20% and our gross margin of 63% to 64%, if we hold true to our 65% gross margin in 2025, which is absolutely our belief, you're already there at 21% of margin.\\nSo, I absolutely understand the mathematics. It just means we're ahead. We're ahead of our LRP, but we're not necessarily willing to update it at this point. We'll come forward and we'll update it at some point in the future.\\nBut I think it's a good thing. We've done a lot of work around this, Joanne, around getting lean and making sure we drive leverage into the business. And the great news is as we are ahead. And so, that's a good spot to be in, and we'll continue to do so.\\nOne other maybe caveat just I think it's important to note on the year. I think you asked the question a little bit about the year and why are we on the year. We're making some good investments this year in the organization. We're launching Stelo, and we talked about that being a significant investment in the business.\\nWe're certainly doing a lot of work around our sales force. And if you recall, a few years ago, we did some work around that, and we took a step back on margin. We're going to do all that and still step forward. We're going to go direct in Japan this year.\\nThat's another thing that we're making an investment in. And then all the work Kevin referenced around the clinical work that we're doing around continuing to improve our product. We're going to make all those investments and still deliver an expansion of operating margins. So, I think it just goes to show you, we're building the levers in here.\\nBut I think you can see that we're building and that you can rely on us longer term to continue to drive that through the business.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\\nMatthew O'Brien -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the domestic performance, there's been a clear acceleration in the back half of '23 on a two-year stacked basis. And I'm wondering specifically if that's just basal that's helping there.\\nIt looks like it's as much as 200, maybe 250 basis points of the acceleration. Is that the primary contributor to the domestic acceleration? What should we think about in terms of basal contribution to the topline this year? And are we inflecting right now as far as basal adoption goes with CGM here in the States? Thanks.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. It's a good question. Let me maybe just give some color as to how we're thinking about the guidance. As you see the performance in the back half of the year, a lot of that has to do with being the most accurate sensor, launching with the G7 form factor, and then, of course, having the basal coverage there.\\nAnd so, when you think about it, and you can see the sharetaking when you look at script data, we are taking share. And having the sensor -- the most advanced sensor on the market is the driver there. So, that's taking share. Now, within those spaces, basal is a contributor, no question.\\nAs that category expands and we take share within that category, that does contribute to the overall numbers. And so, you are right, basal is a contributor, but it has as much to do with us taking share as it does with category expansion. So, think about both of those as contributors. As you think about 2024, we've talked a little bit about the adoption rate, basal in total, adopting in this back half of the year around 9% to 10% per year on a per annum basis.\\nThe guide assumes about 8% there. And so, I think you can assume that was the case. Our long-range plan was more like 6% to 7% per year. So, we are seeing basal going faster than what was in our long-range plan.\\nAnd what's great about that is as we continue to take share and the category grows a little faster than expected, that will help contribute over the longer haul. So, hopefully, that gives you some context to how we're seeing basal. It absolutely is a contributor. I don't want to overstate the fact though that basal because, quite frankly, our intensive insulin businesses continue to do really, really well, and you see us taking share there as well.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nI'd just add to Jereme's comments, Matt. If you look at the second half of the year, that's when G7 rolled out. There is a direct correlation to G7 launching and the acceleration of our growth. It really was an important event.\\nAnd the other thing that just as a consequence of what you saw, again, this supports what we're doing in the U.S. with respect to our field sales expansion. We do need to spend more time with physicians who aren't as familiar with our technology as they would have been in the past. And as I said on the call earlier, where we call on somebody, we win.\\nWe do very well. So, we need more calls. We needed more feet on the street and more voice, given the acceleration that we saw and the good things that we saw happen over the second half of the year. So, it all flows together nicely.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Margaret Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.\\nMargaret Andrew -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe spin back to non-insulin. When we kind of run our market models, non-insulin adoption seems to have meaningfully increased, probably for you as well as certainly for the market the last couple of years.\\nAnd again, our numbers probably aren't perfect, but maybe the market's not at 1 million users in the U.S. Could get there this year, and that's a pretty sizable amount. So, I guess, one, are these meaningful patient adds to DexCom already in 2023? And what drove that? And going back to the Stelo guidance of $40 million per year, we can obviously throw some assumptions around ASPs or patient adds, but regardless of what those inputs can be, it pretty quickly gets you to $200 million plus sales in 2025, which is a pretty meaningful chunk of the chain. So, I guess, is that correct? Why could it be right or wrong? And how much of that could be incremental to the initial LRP that you provided in '23? Thanks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nJereme can probably get into more detail than me. It is a part of our business today, Margaret. We do have some non-insulin users for our product. We have some plans that actually cover non-insulin users for CGM.\\nAnd we've seen -- had wonderful experiences there. We also have not an aggressive cash pay program, but a cash pay program nonetheless, where non-insulin users have access to our product through some very traditional distribution channels outside the pharmacy and outside traditional DME. So, some of those individuals have purchased CGM and use it on the non-insulin front as well, and we continue to support programs. But it is not a remarkable chunk of our business.\\nIt has not been a tremendous driver of our growth. It has grown, but it hasn't been a significant percentage. As we look going forward, certainly, again, we gave guidance of 1% for 2024, and we're committed to that. And that certainly is our forecast and what we've guided.\\nWe're most committed to learning because what we're really interested in is a number like $200 million, like you're talking about for 2025 and to be positioned with the right product there. With respect to pricing and how to launch that product, we're going to have tremendous flexibility as this is a cash pay program. And it's not labeled for the current population where we have reimbursement, and where we're reimbursed for our products. So, we believe we'll have, again, flexibility to grow that.\\nAnd growing profitably. So, again, we have a 15-day product going into that market. So, we will have lower COGS. And we're developing a lot of things around that as it rolls out.\\nAs you see, we really are changing the business model to serve this type of individual versus those we've served up to this point in time. We're going to offer a different experience and we'll definitely meet their needs across the board. So, we're bullish on it over time, and it could be a very big number in 2025. That's what we're planning on.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\\nJayson Bedford -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Just on gross margin, I think we came in the last year thinking gross margin would be lower in the second half. It wasn't. I'm guessing revenue levels play a part there.\\nBut outside of price and mix, what weighs on gross margin in '24? And then just as a related question, you had some encouraging comments on Malaysia, and I think you alluded to it, but at what point do we see Malaysia and G7 starting to have a positive impact on gross margin?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHey, Jayson. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Last year, when we made the assumption on what the margin looked like, the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition.\\nWe had a range of assumptions. But the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition would take place perhaps a little bit earlier. And some of that had to do with timing of when the AID systems were available in the market and coverage, and how that goes over time. And so, it took a little bit longer.\\nAnd as a result, we outperformed on margin and it gets back to G6 cost less to make the G7 today. And still, a majority of our users, our legacy base, still sit on the G6 system. With the launch of Tandem and Control-IQ integrated with G7 and obviously, the limited launch with Omnipod 5 coming out here in the back half of Q1, and then obviously, a launch sometime later in the year, we do believe that base starts to move over quicker. And so, what you have there is as that takes place, Jason, you have that shift from a lower cost to a higher-cost product weighing in the start of the year.\\nAnd hence, that's why the margin goes where it goes. Now, in the back half of the year, assuming that base transitions and our models show that over the course of the year, that should. The equilibrium should balance then tilt in the favor of G7. It puts us in a position exiting the year where G7 should be, and we'll have to give you updates on the base as the year progresses, but it should be lower than G6, within at that point, it should be accretive.\\nAnd that would be the exit rate leading now to '24 and then, of course, then bodes well as we move into 2025 and beyond. So, that's the big driver. It's just when does that base transition. And when it does, when do we have that cost kind of equilibrium? So, again, we thought it was going to happen in the back half of 2023.\\nIt didn't take place. We outperformed there in 2023 as a result. Probably going to take place here in the first half of 2024.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Will Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\\nWill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just kind of a follow-up.\\nJust trying to get a color, granularity if possible as you look at the growth in the business and kind of Matt O'Brien's question, but the contribution from basal, hypo, intensive, and type 1, just is it kind of shifting to that order these days where it's more of the basal and hypo and the intensive type 2, is really the new patient growth? And then if so, how should we think about that cadence as you continue to move forward? Thanks.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. I mean, if you think about 2024 at least, 2024, the main contributor to new patients or at least revenue from new patients is still going to sit in the intensive insulin, so the type 1 and type 2 insulin-intensive patients. And that still is where the combination of those two makes up a majority of the new revenue over the course of the year. Basal is catching up, and basal is doing a nice job of catching up, but those in still part of our core business is still actually driving the underlying business.\\nNow, over time, we do expect basal, given it's a larger population to do very, very well. We'll have to give you more of an update as we get into 2025 and beyond as we get closer to that. So, incredibly bullish on the long-term opportunity there with basal. But think about at least 2024, our core business is actually still driving a lot of the growth with obviously longer-term opportunities in basal and then to your point, hypo, which is, quite frankly, still a low contributor, and then with Stelo kind of coming online as well.\\nAll of those are real opportunities in 2025 and beyond.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask a follow-up on Kevin, your response to the prior question on 15-day and timing. I heard we won't provide a lot of color until we've filed and see a path to approval.\\nThere kind of had been -- it seems like there was a thought that Stelo was kind of the appetizer this year for 15-day and maybe a broader rollout in 2025. And I don't want to -- I'm not asking you to pin down timing but is 2025 a year where a broader transition to 15-day could be affected? Or might all this testing and innovation take a little longer?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe would like to go as fast as possible. If it were on my time frame, it would be yesterday. Stelo at 15 days is a primer for that, so we can learn and gather data from those users as they use it, particularly with our current sensor configuration. As we go through the technology changes that we're making, as we dial in on those features that we're going to put in the final product, we'll get a pivotal trial started and we'll go, but we're learning each and every day.\\nWe are not in a position like we were with G7, where we're submitting an entire new system with completely new hardware and new features and new manufacturing lines, new suppliers, new everything. This 15-day product, we built on the same platform our current G7 is built. So, the time from finishing and pivotal to filing is not going to be near as intent and difficult as it was, with the last product, things such as security and Bluetooth and stuff. We worked through all those issues already.\\nSo, right now, it's really refining the science and getting to 15 days and getting that reliability and quality level that our patients expect from us. We don't view this as an extremely -- I think '25 is a reasonable assumption, but I'm not going to give you an end date as to when because there's too many variables. But we're certainly headed down a path along that type of speed and then we'll see where we land and give you more updates along the way. I just -- filing things or starting things.\\nWhat's important to us is getting things done. And those should be your milestones as well. So, we'll keep you posted, but that's where we are.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is open.\\nChris Pasquale -- Nephron Research -- Analyst\\nThanks. Congrats on the quarter. Wanted to ask a couple of questions about Dexcom ONE and the progress there. I think you had said you expected it to account for about 30% of international new patient starts in '23.\\nCurious if that's where you ended up and what portion of new patient starts you expect it to be in '24.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Yes, we did -- we thought it was going to be about a third of patient starts in 2023 outside the U.S. It was closer to about a quarter of new patient starts.\\nSo, a little bit behind there. Some of the tenders took a little bit more time to get on and -- so it was still a really good year for us, but a little bit behind where we had started the year, at least on the expectations. This year, we expect it to be more and a bigger contributor as a percentage. So, if you think about last year, that was certainly the case.\\nThat was on the G6 form factor. Very excited about, obviously, coming out here on the G7 form factor here in 2024 and the four countries that we already launched in. So, our expectation is a bit bigger percentage, while we haven't necessarily given that number, expect it to be bigger and the team wants it to be bigger as a percentage of new patients outside the U.S. in 2024.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask a follow-up on the type 2 hypo non-insulin -- hypo indication that has coverage.\\nWe didn't think it would move as fast as type 2 basal. But I think you guys talked about a bigger patient opportunity in the U.S. than the type 2 basal patient opportunity. Anything that's been a bottleneck in terms of penetrating that indication? And just how do you see a deeper penetration going forward, into '24, '25, '26? Thanks a lot.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Thanks, Josh. It's an area that -- in all candor, it's gone. And we knew this is going to be a bit of a challenge.\\nIt's a big opportunity, but it's going to take a little bit more time on awareness and getting in front of the physicians and letting folks know that, hey, look, if you've had a hypo event, you do qualify. And by the way, here's how to document it. So, it has been certainly slower than basal. It's not been a real all that material contributor in 2023.\\nWhat we do know, however, is Teri, our chief commercial officer, and her team are very, very focused in getting the word out. And making sure that folks understand if they are suffering with hypo events, this technology can help, and it can help change that and that they do qualify and there is reimbursement out there. And so, it's working on that messaging and making sure that we get out there and understand where those events are taking place. That is, believe it or not, it is a challenge in understanding how to identify when those have took place so that we can get out in front of those folks, but we are working on it.\\nWe have good data around that. And then making sure we're making those physicians that are then serving those patients aware of what the requirements are for documentation so that they can qualify for reimbursement. So, there's some work to be done, but there's a team working very, very intently on it. And making sure that we do arm our sales force and then arm the community with the information needed to help it grow faster.\\nI think it's a big opportunity for us, but I think it's an opportunity that's going to take a little bit longer to penetrate. So, to your point, I think it's a driver -- it's a driver a little bit here in 2024, certainly an opportunity in 2024, but I think it's going to continue to slow roll. But over the longer haul, we do think this is a contributor over time that can be meaningful.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nI'd just add to that. It feeds to the sales force investment we're making in the states. We need to educate physicians and patients. And once you get a population of people who have positive outcomes in this space, and they go back to their doctors and those conversations start taking place, this becomes easier.\\nBut there's a lot of seeding that we have to do to do it, and we needed more feet on the street to do that.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. One clarifying one on basal. You've previously talked about framing the penetration within basal population relative to the trajectory you saw in insulin-intensive type 2 patients.\\nHow would you characterize that comparison based on where you are today and also as you're looking out over the next few years?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Yeah. So, in our long-term guide, we had talked about basal, effectively being about six to seven points of adoption as a percentage of the total population here in the U.S. And I'll start with the U.S.\\nbecause internationally, there's a coverage. As we work through coverage there, there's opportunities. But we had talked about that in our 2025 LRP. In our first couple of quarters, we saw it mirror that to your question, to your point, I should say, that it was mirroring the type 2 intensive, which was about a 9% to 10% penetration rate.\\nOur guide, at least for 2024, assumes a middle between those two, 8%. We've got a couple of quarters under our belt. It's very, very positive, but we also want to make sure we're prudent when it comes to guidance. And so, that's why we've assumed about an 8% penetration rate over the course of 2024.\\nObviously, if it mirrors that, which we saw in the back half of 2023, there's opportunities to outperform. And clearly, we're tracking ahead of our LRP, which I think is both positive signals, I think, for the business in total. But again, our guidance has been 8% as a percent of penetration. Hopefully, that helps you.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\\nSteve Lichtman -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\\nThank you. Good evening, guys. Kevin, you mentioned to an earlier question, different business models for Stelo. How should we think what the go-to-market could look like? Does it have a Dexcom ONE more direct-to-patient feel? And do you need to make any significant investments in back-office support as the denominator really expand as you go after this large non-insulin group?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThat's a great question, and that is a very pertinent topic of discussion and meeting here within the walls of our company. We are very much evaluating very efficient ways to serve such a large patient group and a patient group that may interact differently with us than those who've been on insulin over time as we build those models out. So, we are looking at distribution models that appear different than what we are doing today. So, we can most efficiently get that product to people.\\nAnd again, starting with cash pay, it gives us some opportunities to do things a little different than we've done in the past. And so, you'll have to stay tuned for that. It's a very thoughtful question and very much in line with everything that's going on here every day.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our final question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open.\\nMatt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHey, great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So, one follow-up on margins and kind of mix, as you drive G7 to be a bigger part of your business. You mentioned before, and I think we understand the ramping G7 volumes, improving gross margin and profitability of that product line over time.\\nAnd just wondering if you could share maybe how we should think about the long term. Like in other words, G7 is more profitable now. Do you have a G6 more profitable now rather just the maturity of those lines? So G7 exceeds that. Does Stelo trail G7? Does Dexcom ONE with G7 kind of trail that, maybe just some sense directionally of where those are headed over the intermediate and long term would be super helpful as you drive these volumes up.\\nThanks so much.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, maybe what I'll talk about is how we're thinking about the cost of the product. And then I think from there, we can kind of make some calls on how we think about margin from that perspective. And I'll maybe comment a little bit on the service model, which I think is also important because that will help from the operating margin.\\nSo, as you think about the G7, just the product itself, as of today, it costs more than G6. And so, that will eventually, we expect over the course of this year flip. And as you kind of get your models kind of bent out or kind of laid out, we expect to get down to a $10 sensor, irrespective of whether it's 10 or 15 days as we exit the 2025 LRP into early 2026. So, that gives you some kind of feel for where we'll get to the cost of each sensor.\\nNow, each sensor, the hardware is about the same cost, whether it's Stelo, whether it's Dexcom ONE, or whether it's the G-Series. It's the support models, the software, the support, the R&D, the investment in it, and then, of course, the service models that ultimately then change it. And so, as you think about all of the work that we put into the G-Series, the G-Series will have the highest reimbursement, but it will also have the highest service model and then the most investment in software and otherwise. Dexcom ONE is a little bit more of a different service model.\\nAnd thus, we are able to reduce the burden associated with some of the warranty and then the support cost that play into that. And then Stelo is in a 15-day form factor. And so, that's helpful from a gross margin perspective as you think through that over time. So, I think that's the way to think about the cost profile.\\nWe haven't launched the price of Stelo at this point, so we can't necessarily give you the specific margin at this point. Otherwise, maybe pretty obvious how we're thinking about it. But over time, as that comes out, I think it will help align the models. And I think there's real opportunities here as you think about a 15-day -- a 15-day product, starting with Stelo.\\nBut as that then makes its way through Dexcom ONE and the G-Series over time. Again, more levers there where there are some real opportunities in those product lines to continue to drive profitability. So, I think there's levers across all of these. I hope that gives you some context.\\nI realize I'm not giving you a P&L for each one of them, but at least it gives you some context at the hardware costs and we differentiate on the opex cost and service models and then, of course, the days of wearing each one.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you very much. It's very easy during these earnings calls to talk about percentages and margins and future technologies, financial guidance, competitors, a whole host of important engaging topics. But as we wrap up today, I really want to focus on 2023, which is truly the most remarkable year in our history. Let's review these numbers again, $700 million in organic revenue growth, more than $1 billion in EBITDA, 600,000 new customers in our active user base, standing up a plant in Asia without missing a beat, and, of course, launching our G7 product all over the world.\\nWhile best-in-class technology is foundational and fundamental to these types of accomplishment, it doesn't happen without exceptional people going above and beyond. So, as we close out 2023, I want to thank our -- I guess we're now more than 10,000 DexCom employees around the world. Incredibly well done. Thanks, everybody.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"last_earnings_call_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2024-01-23\",\n          \"2024-02-27\",\n          \"2025-10-30\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nSteve Tanal -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, vice president of investor relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, president and CEO; and Mark Kaye, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon, Morgan Kendrick, president of our commercial health benefits business; and Felicia Norwood, president of our government health benefits business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and year and recent progress against our strategic initiatives.\\nMark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com.\\nWe will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC.\\nI will now turn the call over to Gail. \\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered a strong end to 2023, demonstrating our ability to execute with agility and the balance and resilience of our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62. For the full year, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $25.22 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14.\\n2023 marks the sixth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate with a compound annual growth rate exceeding the high end of the range. This reflects the ongoing execution of our strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities, and optimize our health benefits business. In 2023, we made significant strides building upon our flywheel for growth. Carelon has and will continue to add attractive capabilities that we can scale rapidly and sustainably over the long term.\\nFor example, just a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a company specializing in infusible and injectable therapies. The acquisition expands our capabilities catering to consumers with complex and chronic needs who can benefit the most from our approach to whole-person health. Infusion services will complement our suite of pharmacy services which, today, include a fast-growing specialty pharmacy business and our advanced home delivery service, which launched at the beginning of this year. Carelon Services is poised for strong growth in 2024 with the onboarding of new clients and continued expansion of services provided to Elevance Health medical members, including the rollout of risk-based oncology products and Carelon Insights, as well as the launch of comprehensive Carelon behavioral health management services to address the whole health needs of Medicaid beneficiaries living with serious mental illness.\\nTurning to our health benefits business. 2023 marked another strong year despite a dynamic operating environment. Performance was led by the optimization of our commercial business, where our operating margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows, which will continue into 2025. Commercial customers prioritize affordability, experience, and simplicity, and we're delivering on all fronts.\\nIn 2023, a we launched a series of initiatives designed to improve and simplify the customer experience, including our associates' ability to better serve our members through the integration of AI support and natural language processing, which has significantly improved first call resolution, in addition to enhancing our claims auto-adjudication rate. We're also broadening the use of AI to automate certain aspects of our provider directory and other administrative processes, which have improved data accuracy in consumer and provider experiences. Momentum in our national accounts business is a direct result of the unique and differentiated value we offer to large employers. We continue to consolidate business with existing clients, achieving excellent retention and winning over 75% of employers who ultimately switch carriers despite a smaller pipeline of new accounts for 2024.\\nIn our individual business, we positioned our products thoughtfully to drive profitable and sustainable growth, and we're pleased with our performance in 2023. We're looking forward to even stronger membership growth this year as we focus on maximizing access to care for redetermined Medicaid beneficiaries. Our relentless focus on affordable products, superior customer experiences, and simplicity is yielding strong results. After growing commercial membership by over 400,000 members last year, we are poised to grow by another 750,000 in 2024.\\nMedicaid eligibility redeterminations remain ongoing and, in many states, have accelerated their redetermination processes. To date, over 70% of our members who lost Medicaid coverage were unenrolled for administrative reasons. This is a challenging reality for many families, but we're encouraged that we are nearly two-thirds of the way through the process. With close to 30% of those unenrolled before September 1st having reenrolled in an Elevance Health product.\\nOur research indicates that many unenrolled members are facing barriers to reenrollment including awareness of the process and required actions to maintain coverage. To address this, we're executing an extensive renewal campaign and have reached over 3 million people with our omnichannel approach as we remain committed to supporting them as their trusted health partner. Despite accelerated membership attrition from redeterminations to date, our Medicaid business is performing well. Grades remain actuarially sound for the members we are privileged to serve, and we are innovating to meet their needs.\\nFor example, in 2024, we will expand our community connected care model into eight additional states. This program assists Medicaid members with their health-related social needs by identifying gaps and connecting members to support services in their communities. We will also launch a program in alliance with the affordable connectivity program, major wireless carriers, and Samsung that will help increase equitable access to digital and virtual health tools. The program will provide eligible Medicaid members with a curated selection of digital and virtual health tools via smartphone with no data cap at no cost, along with training materials and ongoing guidance on how to use these tools.\\nStrong performance in 2023 allowed us to invest for the long term. In the fourth quarter, these investments were concentrated in Medicare, where we remain intensely focused on building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth. This includes improving our star quality ratings and driving profitable growth in markets where we know we can win over the long term. Unfortunately, pockets of the Medicare Advantage market have remained hyper competitive despite a more challenging funding environment.\\nWhile our plans continue to offer attractive and valuable benefits, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to address product sustainability, and as such, we experienced greater-than-expected attrition in certain markets. As a result, we expect our Medicare Advantage membership to be roughly flat in 2024 on an organic basis but earnings to improve. Importantly, cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business continued to develop as we expected, and we are confident that the assumptions underlying our bids for 2024 are appropriate. With respect to stars, we have now fully implemented My Health Advocate, our comprehensive, personalized customer service model for Medicare.\\nThis has improved experiences for our members, helping them to easily navigate the healthcare system and their plan benefits. Early proof points reflect an improvement in first call resolution, a key indicator of future quality performance for our Medicare Advantage plans. We are confident that we have a solid foundation in our health benefits business, from which we will grow Carelon for the long term with many of the building blocks in place to accelerate our enterprise flywheel for growth. We are positioned to deliver another year of strong earnings growth in line with our long-term target in 2024, while continuing to invest in our future.\\nWe expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than $37.10 this year, reflecting growth of at least 12% over 2023. Finally, advancing health equity is foundational to our efforts to improve the health and lives of the individuals and communities we are privileged to serve. Our industry-leading approach received renewed recognition when the National Committee for Quality Assurance awarded its newly established health equity accreditation plus to 20 of Elevance Health-affiliated Medicaid health plans covering over 90% of our Medicaid members and making us the only national plan to have received this distinction to date. We also saw excellent progress on our ambitious goal to improve maternal health equity by reducing the disparity in preterm birth rates between Black and non-Black communities, improving the disparity gap by 5.2% relative to our 2022 baseline.\\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to our extraordinary team of over 100,000 associates. It is their collective passion and hard work that enables us to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. This past year alone, our associates logged over 225,000 volunteer hours in our communities, a record high for Elevance Health. This remarkable achievement reflects our deep dedication to making a tangible positive impact on the lives of the people we are privileged to serve and for the communities we call home.\\nAs we move forward, we will remain focused on serving our members as their lifetime trusted health partner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our new chief financial officer, Mark Kaye. Mark?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Gail, and good morning. I am pleased to join you for my first earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. As Gail shared, we delivered strong results every quarter of 2023, including in the fourth quarter, which was marked by solid top- and bottom-line growth and significant progress in the execution of our enterprise strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities, and optimize our businesses. Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62 and full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14 were ahead of expectations.\\nSince 2018, Elevance Health has achieved a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16%, surpassing our long-term target range of 12% to 15%. Operating revenue exceeded 170 billion in 2023, up 9.3% year over year, driven by growth in both our health benefits and Carelon businesses. The benefit expense ratio was 89.2% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the full year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points and 60 basis points respectively compared to the prior-year periods. This was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend, most notably in our commercial health benefits business.\\nThe adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.6% for the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points compared to the prior-year period, driven by accelerated investments made in the quarter, notably in network quality, value-based care, and customer experience initiatives designed to address key priority areas for Medicare Advantage stars. For the full year, the adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.3%, flat year over year. Operating cash flow was 8.1 billion in 2023 or 1.3 times GAAP net income. This includes the benefit of approximately 300 million of state-based payments for 2024 dates of service that we received in the fourth quarter and which will correspondingly impact operating cash flow in 2024.\\nWe ended the year with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9% in line with our targeted range. Given confidence in our outlook, we took advantage of market volatility during the fourth quarter to accelerate share repurchases. Specifically, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for 929 million, bringing total share repurchases for the year to 5.8 million shares at a total cost of 2.7 billion. Our health benefits business ended the year with approximately 47 million members, a decrease of around 570,000 year over year, driven by attrition in Medicaid associated with eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by growth in our commercial fee-based membership.\\nToday, we are seven to eight months into the Medicaid redetermination process. And while there is significant variability by state, we believe that nearly two-thirds of our members have had their eligibility evaluated. Of those unenrolled, approximately 70% have lost coverage due to administrative reasons. And we have also seen an elongation in the time some beneficiaries have taken to reenroll into Medicaid while others have transitioned on to an ACA exchange plan.\\nAs Gail noted, we are executing an extensive renewal campaign to maximize continuity of coverage Accordingly, we expect reenrollment into Medicaid continue through at least 2024 and for growth in ACA exchange plans to accelerate. This has been incorporated into our membership guidance ranges for 2024. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024. We are pleased to provide initial guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of greater than $37.10, reflecting growth of at least 12% year over year.\\nWe are focused on optimizing our health benefits business, including through the ongoing margin recovery of our commercial risk-based business, the strategic repositioning of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings in certain markets, and the transformation of our cost structure. Further, we are investing in high-growth opportunities with a focus on establishing a foundation for sustained long-term growth. We will scale Carelon's existing capabilities and add new ones in 2024 and driving incremental earnings growth and accelerating our enterprise flywheel for growth. The momentum in our commercial health benefits and Carelon businesses is partially offset by the Medicaid membership headwinds included in our guidance.\\nWe anticipate total medical membership to end 2024 in the range of 45.8 million to 46.6 million, down approximately 750,000 year over year at the midpoint. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members, with attrition driven by the net loss of approximately 930,000 members associated with changes in our footprint discussed on our third-quarter earnings call and ongoing eligibility redeterminations. Commercial membership is expected to grow by over 750,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 32.4 million to 32.8 million members. This includes over 300,000 net new risk-based members and approximately 400,000 net new fee-based members collectively driven by new business wins and strong client retention, reflecting our resolute focus on customer affordability, experience, and simplicity.\\nMedicare Advantage membership is expected to end the year approximately flat. As a reminder, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to improve the sustainability of our product offerings, and given unexpected competitive dynamics in certain markets, experienced greater-than-expected attrition. Nonetheless, these actions will help establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long term. And we remain confident in the outlook for utilization and medical cost trends embedded in our 2024 bids.\\nFinally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits membership to remain relatively stable year over year. On a consolidated basis, operating revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up low single digits. We project operating earnings for the year to be at least 10.3 billion, reflecting 9% growth with contributions from both our health benefits and Carelon businesses, disciplined benefit management, and the successful execution of our 2023 business optimization initiatives. Please note that our guidance metrics do not include the impact of pending M&A, even though we have several transactions we expect to close this year.\\nEarnings seasonality is expected to be relatively consistent year over year with slightly more than 55% of our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first half of the year and more than half of that expected in the first quarter. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our board of directors recently approved a 10.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.63 per share. This marks our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, underscoring our commitment to delivering strong results for our shareholders and the value of our balanced and resilient business model. In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the company, and I'm looking forward to working alongside the talented and dedicated team at Elevance Health to deliver on our financial targets.\\nI look forward to meeting all of you in 2024. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Once again, we ask that each participant limit themselves to a single question to allow ample time to respond to each analyst that may wish to participate in this portion of the call. For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\\nA.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Welcome on board, Mark. Congratulations to the company for another year of meeting the growth targets. And I know it's early to talk about this, but maybe you'd have to take some steps today to ensure your positioning.\\nWith 2025, you'll have the star ratings impact to overcome. When you think about that, will the company do anything differently? How do you think about the levers you have to push to offset what appears at least on the surface to be a couple percentage points of headwind from that star ratings impact. Will you step up share repurchases, accelerate investments in Carelon? How do you think about that at this early date and the ability to sustain that 12% to 15% even into next year?\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, A.J. There's a lot in there. And as you know, '25, it's a little early to opine on '25, but I'd like to give you at least a little bit of color on how we're thinking about some of the things that you mentioned. Let me start first with star ratings.\\nBecause as we shared on the last we are intensely working. Medicare Advantage is a very important business for us, and we're strategically committed to the long term. And I will reiterate this year, we felt we took very prudent actions for a long-term sustainable business and feel good about our bids. So, that positions us well for 2025 in particular.\\nIn terms of the star ratings, again, a few things going on there. We shared on our last call that on the group business, we have a number of levers at our disposal that we are able to pull, and we're still moving forward with that. And then in terms of overall star ratings, we do think that, that's going to be a multiyear initiative. But I wanted to share -- as I shared on my early remarks that we have invested at the last part of the year, and we were investing actually prior to even the announcement.\\nWe have been successful at moving all of our business into our health advocate model, and we do know that we're seeing some early signs. We don't know where the points are going to come out, but we do feel good about the investments we're making. And again, we feel really good about where our bids have come out. Broader, let me take a little bit step further back because I think your question around 25 is broader than just Medicare Advantage and stars.\\nAs I think about '25 again, not giving guidance on '25, but we do expect to accelerate growth in 2025, and we've talked quite a bit in recent calls about our flywheel for growth, which is on our improvement in both the health benefits business and our Carelon segment. We anticipate that our health benefits business is going to continue to grow in '25 after a reset year in '24. We should see an accelerated impact to that growth, which will drive revenue for Carelon. And then Carelon also has been independently scaling its multiple new capabilities, and we'll share, I assume, even more of those on the call today.\\nAnd then finally, as you know, we took some actions at the end of last year around our disciplined operating cost efficiencies, and we expect to see even greater benefits from those as we digitize and use AI in our investments. So, honestly, I think we feel that we've positioned our business very prudently, and that the balance and resilience of our enterprise and our earnings power of our health benefits in Carelon together gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. So, just a little bit more color on where we are. Thank you very much.\\nAnd next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nKevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask about the MLR guidance for 2024. It sounds like you guys are expecting margin improvement in MA, your repositioning commercial, and Medicaid is dropping pretty meaningfully.\\nBut why is MLR only flat? I would think that we'd be seeing MLR improvement. Is there some offset in there?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning, and thank you very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the 2023 just to set the context here. So, 2023 benefit expense ratio, end of the year, slightly better than our initial expectations at that 87%. And just to remind you, that represented the 60 basis point improvement year over year as well as falling in the lower half of our initial 2023 guidance range.\\nAs it relates to 2024, we are guiding to a flat benefit expense ratio of 87%, plus-minus 50 basis points. And our outlook here reflects a consistent approach to reserves and a prudent thought process around utilization, given the dynamic operating environment, especially for our government businesses. If I take a deeper look at the underlying businesses themselves, the health benefit expense ratio reflects that intentional management action we're taking in commercial. It will continue on through into 2024 around the disciplined underwriting practices and part of our margin recovery efforts.\\nAnd then certainly, on the Medicare the advantage side, continued appropriate expectations around utilization and Medicare -- medical cost trends.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark, and thanks, Kevin, for the question. Next, question please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\\nJosh Raskin -- Nephron Research -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically around the growth in Medicare Advantage to start this year. It sounds like a little bit lower than expectations.\\nAnd I'm curious specifically in the commentary you made around pockets of competition, maybe where you're seeing that, what you think is driving that. And then any specific comments on retention relative to expectations for this year?\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks, Josh, very much for the question. And just maybe a couple of overarching comments because I think it's important that I'm going ask solution Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to comment more specifically. And I think it's important to frame that we made some very specific discipline decisions and feel really good about our bids entering into this. And Felicia, we actually exited some markets very specifically that were underperforming.\\nSo, I think you have to take that into account. But she'll provide a lot more detail on kind of where we landed this year and the perspective on the market. So, Felicia, please?\\nFelicia Norwood -- President, Government Business Division\\nSure. Good morning, Josh, and thank you very much for that question. As we headed into 2024, we made some very disciplined decisions that we were going to enhance the financial performance for our Medicaid Advantage business. In the mainland, we exited a scale noted specifically certain markets that have been underperforming for us for years.\\nAnd with the impending risk model revisions, we really saw no path to long-term attractive sustainable economics in those markets. And that really represented a decline of about 84,000 members. I also want to note that we reduced supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico, both to turn around their performance after a very challenging 2023 and to position us for the three-year phase-in of the risk model revisions, which will have a material adverse impact on Medicare Advantage on the island, in part due to the higher mix of duals that we have in Puerto Rico. So, we've reset our supplemental benefits there, and in the midst of a very highly competitive bid environment, we will see membership declines somewhere in the neighborhood of about 90,000 in 2024 in Puerto Rico.\\nNow, while the decline is larger than we expected, it certainly has bolstered our confidence in the anticipated improvement in our benefit expense ratio in Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, what we wanted to do was to establish a very strong foundation from which we can grow in Puerto Rico long term, sustainably and profitably. Back to the mainland. Selling activity for AEP was actually very strong for us as we expected.\\nWhen we exclude the planned attrition on the island that we mentioned in -- on the mainland that I mentioned earlier, our net mainland Medicare Advantage membership would be on track to grow by high single digits this year, despite encountering greater disenrollment in certain markets due to very aggressive offerings by select competitors. At the end of the day, I think that we've made very thoughtful decisions around how we're going to position our business for long-term sustainable growth going forward. And we've done the things that we've always committed to do. We expect to do very well in our blue markets.\\nWe are performing better in our blue markets than the overall growth rates, and we're very much focused on a combination of balancing that perspective between margin and membership growth. So, we feel good about how we're positioning our business going forward. And as we said earlier, in light of all of these dynamics, we'd expect to have flat membership in 2024.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\\nSarah James -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst\\nThank you. You guys have some really nice margin expansion guided to for Carelon in 2024. I was wondering if you could unpack it a little bit for us as we think through the major buckets that are causing the expansion. And then also the pacing, if it's ratable as we think about the margin expansion due 2024 and then, I guess, further out as we get to 2027.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Thank you, Sarah. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon, to comment on that. And as you know, we're excited about the real flywheel opportunity that we're seeing in Carelon.\\nSo, Pete?\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nYes. Let me -- thank you, Sarah, for the question. Let me talk about Carelon Services growth. And we are very excited about the opportunity and the progress that we're making with respect to services growth.\\nI think you saw that play through in 2023. We committed to double-digit increase on revenue, which we achieved. And as it relates to our 2024 guide, you saw that we're talking about high teens, low 20s growth. And it's really playing through our strategy that we talked about, focusing in on complexities in healthcare, high-cost spend areas, and really driving capitated risk in key areas to support our health plans.\\nIn '23, we did that with our post-acute care initiative, DME, wound care. And as we move forward into 2024, I mean, Gail mentioned this in the prepared remarks, we have new offerings that are whole health full-risk opportunities, like oncology, assuming full risk in oncology as well as in Medicaid with behavioral health with the seriously mental ill population. So, these are significant initiatives that are really propelling the trajectory of our business. I would also say that -- as it relates to external growth, we're also seeing really nice improvements from that perspective and really nice momentum.\\nOur pipeline in '23 for '24 growth was much more significant. In terms of our sales this time versus last year, we've seen a real nice trajectory in our growth. And we've had a couple of really nice notable wins with the blues. I would say that as it relates to that and the opportunity with the blues, they are doing exactly what we've talked about in the past and looking closely at some of these full-risk comprehensive offerings that we're delivering in Elevance Health.\\nAnd then very interested in that in terms of the opportunities to create predictable stable cost of care for them. So, very pleased with where we are in the trajectory of growth in Carelon.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\\nStephen Baxter -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hi, thank you. I just want to come back to the Medicaid redetermination process. So, entering 2023, we're expecting some normalization of the Medicaid outperformance that you saw in years prior.\\nCan you give us an update on where that landed in 2023 compared to your initial thinking? And then just a little bit more color on what your guidance assumes for Medicaid in 2024. Does that put you back at historical norms for margins? Or should we think -- should we be thinking about something else there? Thank you.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nStephen, thanks very much for the question. On Medicaid membership, our outlook reflects the footprint adjustments we spoke about on our third-quarter earnings call and the continued attrition due to redetermination. We believe Medicaid redeterminations are approximately two-thirds complete across our Medicaid markets. And in general, we've seen more front-loaded disenrollment, notably in a few large states that have elected to adopt accelerated processes.\\nAnd then based on the trends that we've observed relative -- or related to these marketwide coverage shifts, we have adjusted our Medicaid retention assumption to be approximately 30% of our PHE related growth. We're not planning to provide point estimates for coverage transitions generally. We do, however, believe that ACA will pick up more than initially expected. While employer group coverage will gain a little bit less than initially expected.\\nBut most importantly, these updated projections are factored into our membership guidance that we provided this morning.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\\nLance Wilkes -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\nYes, thanks. Could you talk a little bit about your value-based care strategies? And what I would be interested in is from a contracting standpoint, how are you approaching that for '24 and like MA? Are you doing any sort of renegotiation to kind of hold those value-based care providers more stable in that year given the risk adjustment changes? And then how is the priority for owning those sorts of assets in Carelon change? And what's your current outlook there? Thanks.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, Lance. It's quite a bit there. But I think let me start with our value-based strategy, we've talked about on this call a number of times, and I think I would say it's remained really consistent, but we're making a lot of very good progress on that. Overall, more than 60% are in value-based care.\\nAnd in Medicare, it's even more. Specific to your question on renegotiation, we have multiple-year arrangements with our value-based providers, and we're always looking at a couple of things. One, quite frankly, to make sure that it's a win-win and we're aligned, both on cost quality outcomes and stars. So, we spend a lot of time focusing on some of the ways that we can get data back and forth more simply.\\nWe use our -- we've integrated the way we share data back and forth, and that's really around closing gaps in care and quite frankly, simplifying the process under which we work with those providers. Our goal is to make that ubiquitous across all of our value-based providers. And so, we made a lot of progress there and dramatically improve sort of the time to action with those providers. And I think that's important because, honestly, that gives them data to act, and that improves their outcomes.\\nWe have seen our value-based providers perform better in the circumstance, and we think that that's going to remain important. In terms of our strategy around ownership, we've talked about that. We -- as you know, we do have assets inside of Carelon. I guess where I would focus you more is around the specialty high-cost complex areas of specialty because that's where we think that there's a huge differentiated focus between our technology, our clinical domain expertise, and our ability to drive trend.\\nAgain, we don't need to own the providers, but we do need to have a significant role in the enablement of those care providers, and we have spent time doing that. We launched a number of new products this year with oncology, serious mental illness, and we're getting into other areas like musculoskeletal, renal, and more. And I think that's where you see the significant spend areas accelerating, and Carelon with its assets has a great opportunity. So, we expect Carelon's care provider enablement platforms continue to contribute pretty significantly Carelon's revenue meaningfully over the longer term, and we're building those assets.\\nAnd again, I'll keep going back to my flywheel where we think that will improve the performance of our health benefit plans. There's a lot of interest in -- externally in these. And Pete mentioned, we saw some nice traction in a few of these offerings this year. So, overall, I'd say very consistent focus around our value-based care enablement, and we feel like we're getting a lot of traction.\\nAnd I would focus you a lot on the specialized care specialty care, particularly on the Carelon growth opportunity. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Two on the Medicare business.\\nFirst, you talked about Medicare cost trend developing as expected in the fourth quarter. I guess I'd be curious if there are any areas that came in higher or lower than expected and what the benefit expense guidance for 2024 assumes for Medicare cost trend? And then I guess, higher level, as you reposition the Medicare business, and I understand there's several moving pieces over the next couple of years, what's the company's current view, I guess, first of the Medicare Advantage market longer term? But then second, the membership growth and margin potential for Elevance, specifically within that market context? Thank you.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you for the question. I'm going to ask Mark to address your first question, and then I'll come back and share our long-term views on Medicare.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNathan, overall utilization in the fourth quarter developed largely in line with our expectations. And that's evidenced by our reported benefit expense ratio, which came in favorable, as you know, to consensus and really to the midpoint of our initial full-year 2023 guidance range. We did see pockets of high utilization, specifically in Medicare related to orthopedics, such as knee and hip replacements and other outpatient procedures. But this is broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost-trained assumptions.\\nSimilarly, we saw a seasonal uptick in respiratory elements, including the flu and COVID, as well as increased RC vaccinations. But again, utilizations were aligned with what we planned. We'll continue to monitor our claims trends closely, including prior authorization data. We remain confident that our Medicare Advantage bids for 2024 and our pricing commercial do reflect appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Nathan, in terms of your broader question, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. As I think about the market, we still think Medicare Advantage is a very good long-term market. And as I said, we're committed to driving sustainable performance for the long term.\\nMedicare Advantage delivers really strong differentiated value for seniors. I think you have to start there. And as you look at the aligned incentives across the system to deliver better outcomes and better care, it is very -- it's a very strong marketplace, and it continues to grow. And importantly, it's incredibly popular with seniors with greater than 50% of seniors selecting Medicare Advantage today.\\nSo, that -- against that backdrop, we know seniors value stability in their benefits year over year and the items that are most important to them. And so, we have, as you heard from us earlier, look to make sure that we are in this market for the long term balancing that stability. So, with what we know is happening in this market, we can make the right benefit decisions and again, feel that we positioned ourselves and are making the right strategic investments to improve our performance. We see this business maturing, as Mark shared in his comments as well.\\nAnd again, been very intentional about our desire or decision to exit certain programs or markets and plans where we didn't think we had a long-term sustainable path to performance. And that, combined with the risk models, made that choice and then again, reposition Puerto Rico, which we believe is still a very good market, but there were some actions that we knew we had to take. So, as we look at those decisions for the long term, as Felicia shared, our business performed when you look at the mainland and take out those exits. We had very strong selling season.\\nAgain, I think that's a testament to the value of the benefits and our position. And importantly, we do believe we can grow this business profitably even in a year with hypercompetitive markets in certain cases where we outperformed the growth in our blue markets, which, again, has always been a strategy we've had is to go deeper in our blue markets and to gain more share with the value of our brand as well as in other places. So, again, we think it's a good market. We know we have some work to do in that market, but we feel we're positioning for the long term and think that we can add distinctive value for seniors as part of our focus on whole health and continuation of coverage to stay blue for life and all of their coverage.\\nSo, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nLisa Gill -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nThanks very much, and good morning. I want to focus on margin drivers. Can you maybe just spend a little time talking about the progression in 2024, getting to those targets that you have in '25? And then secondly, when I think about the margins in CarelonRx, you talked about them improving by 40 to 60 basis points. Can you talk about what the drivers are there as well? Is that Paragon Health and BioPlus, which I would assume carry better margins? Or is there something else that's really driving that improvement as we move into '24?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLisa, thank you very much for the question. I'll talk about health benefits, and I'll pass it over to Pete in a couple of minutes to talk about Carelon. On the health benefits side, we are seeing operating margins expands or expect to expand by 25 to 50 basis points in 2024. And I think about this as really being driven by three primary categories.\\nFirst is the continued underwriting discipline and the pricing actions that we're taking in commercial. 2023 really marks the end of the first full year of our efforts to recover margins from the pandemic-era lows, and we expect those supporting initiatives really to continue through 2024 and then possibly into 2025. Second one I'd call your attention to here really relates to the Medicare margin expansion. And here, as you've heard us talk about, this is about building that strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth in 2024 and striking that balance between growth and margin.\\nAnd in 2024, we leaned a little bit more toward the margin and the growth, and you see that come through in some of our outlook projections this morning. And then the third one I'd call your attention to is really the operating expense leverage. You see that we are gaining additional incremental leverage in 2024 with our guide down to 11.1% for the operating expense ratio.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nThanks, Mark. And, Lisa, your question was on the trajectory of the margins in pharmacy. So, you'll recall that this year, in 2023, we made pretty significant investments as it relates to the acceleration of BioPlus and advanced home delivery, and that puts some pressure on our margins in 2023. That will not repeat itself in 2024.\\nWe did go live with BioPlus on January 1, as well as with respect to advanced on delivery. We're really excited about that, and it's moving in the right direction. And over time, we've built those products for scale. And as that business builds and progresses, we will continue to see margin improvement.\\nSo, that is what is delivering an improvement in margin in '24.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNext question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\\nScott Fidel -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could -- just on the commercial risk enrollment guidance, if you can break that down for us between group and individual? And then on the individual piece, I'm curious in terms of what you're thinking in terms of how much of that growth comes from the catchers mitt for Medicaid. And then how you're thinking about the acuity of those lives that are coming into the exchanges from Medicaid? We know that in Medicaid, that acuity is generally rising as the redeterminations continue.\\nSo, I'm curious, though, in terms of those lives that are transitioning into the exchanges, are you thinking about those as being sort of higher or lower or in line acuity with the legacy population in the exchange market? Thanks a lot.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, thanks for the question, Scott. I think we've got about four or five in there. So, we'll try to hit the high points of your question. Let me ask Morgan and then Mark to comment on your question.\\nMorgan?\\nMorgan Kendrick -- President, Commercial Health Benefits Business\\nYes, Scott, thanks for the question. As we think about the ACA business, we've talked about it for a while now, we're quite bullish on that segment. And as we've remarked in other quarterly reports, we operate in all rating areas in our 14 geographies where we can. And certainly, we've seen an expansion in the actual market share and the market growth actually in these geographies.\\nIn fact, it's certainly a big driver is Medicaid redetermination. As we've indicated earlier on the call today, we've concluded about two-thirds of those. We expect that to continue in 2024. And also, as we've noted in the past, we've seen an elongated period of time from when someone is redetermined and when they actually join Medicare or come on an ACA product moving along.\\nThat said, quite pleased that our growth this year is outpacing our market growth. So, clearly, we're picking up our fair share and more, quite honestly, of the Medicaid redetermined members. So, at the end of the day, this will continue. We've had a very steadfast and steady approach around the right economics and the right network strategies to draw in these members.\\nIt's very important for the business to continue. And I'm going to turn that over to Mark to speak a little bit about the margins and the separation of the various pieces that you asked the questions on.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. If I think about Medicaid rates and acuity, the conversations with the states are ongoing. We'll continue to work with them and their consultants, really to ensure that all adjustments are reasonable and reflect the risk associated with ongoing redeterminations in 2024. Our outlook for 2024 does assume a normalization of Medicaid margins -- we already have line of sight into about 70% of Medicaid premiums for 2024.\\nAnd we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the underlying rates, especially understanding the acuity for leavers versus stayers.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. And thanks, Scott. And I think you also asked about the acuity in the individual exchange marketplace. So, I wanted to just put a fine point on that.\\nOur risk profile of the members we're picking up certainly in '23, obviously, early in '24, very much aligns with the expectation of what we've historically had. So, we feel it's actually rolling out to our expectations. So, thank you for the question. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nBen Hendrix -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nThank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on the Carelon margin question. On Carelon Services, slightly down margins in the guidance. Just wanted to see if that -- the degree to which that is associated with new risk-based arrangements or membership or to the -- perhaps to the new behavioral benefits and kind of what are the prospects for that kind of ramping up beyond 2024? Thanks.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nThanks for the questions. First of all, we're very pleased with the operating performance of Carelon. You saw that play through in 2023. I think we committed to 25 to 50 basis points of improvement.\\nYou saw 70 basis points of improvement year over year. So, that -- it's performing really well. You answered the question already as it relates to 2024. Quite frankly, we are, as Gail talked about and as I talked about earlier, launching some very significant at-risk product offerings, both oncology, seriously mentally ill population, as well as others, and that comes with a lower margin in the earlier years, but that improves over time.\\nSo, that is precisely what was creating the pressure on the margin in '24.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. And just to sort of put a finer point on it, we do remain confident in our long-term guidance that we gave in mid to upper single-digit operating margin. So, as Pete said, we think the business we're bringing on is really good. We're committed to bringing in more risk business.\\nBut in the early years, that does have a little bit lower profile. But overall, we feel very good about the long term. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nJustin Lake -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nThanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of numbers here. First, you reported $200 million-plus of positive prior year development a quarter, materially more than I think the company has ever seen in Q4.\\nJust curious, given the MLR was generally in line, can you tell us whether there were any pressure areas that worked to offset the benefit of the PYD in the quarter? And then with the benefits repositioning of Medicare Advantage, which we've clearly done, do you expect to be within your 3% to 5% target margin here for Medicare Advantage in '24? Thanks.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nJustin, thank you very much for the question this morning. We are confident that our year-end reserves are prudent and have been set consistent with historical practice. In the quarter, you are correct that we saw positive prior-year development on a gross basis, and that was indeed favorable. It's worth pointing out here that that was largely offset through premium rebates and colors, as well as the reestablishment of reserves for the current year.\\nAn alternative way to think about this is that our full-year days in claims payable decreased just 0.2 days year over year. And that's noteworthy in the context of the fact that we have observed cycle times to have actually decreased more than three days, since the end of December 2022. And that should give you a feel for our comfort level around reserves. On your second question, just relative to the long-term target margin ranges, commercial is on track to achieve our long-term goals.\\nLet's say, Medicaid is normalizing but continues to perform well. And then Medicare Advantage for now is below our long-term target margin range.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nGary Taylor -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on enrollment. I kind of thought the story for '23 was that with the intentional commercial repricing, which has been pretty successful this year, you lost some commercial risk enrollment because of that. And I'm just trying to figure out on the million plus decline in risk enrollment for '24, how much of that is commercial risk versus the expected Medicaid redeterminations.\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWe're all pleased with the performance of our commercial business in the fourth quarter and in 2023. We did make meaningful progress toward our margin recovery goals in the year. I'd say January renewals have gone well. We certainly experienced to-date higher retention than we did at the same period last year.\\nRepricing actions, as you would expect, do continue to impact membership growth, but this is expected. And so, we're really continuing to expect approximately flat membership growth overall in our group risk business this year, while continuing to improve margins in line with our stated goals.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. And just again, to put a fine point, most of the losses in risk membership is driven by both the Medicaid redeterminations and the adjustment in the footprints that we've shared with you in the past. So, that really is the key driver. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nNext, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\\nDave Windley -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\nThanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to go to CarelonRx on the revenue growth side. High growth in '23. Low single digits, I think, you're expecting in '24, I suspect, the BioPlus acquisition inorganically would have contributed to some of that growth in '23, but I don't think it bridges the full change.\\nSo, maybe you could add some color around the slowdown in growth, the lower growth expectations for CarelonRx in '24? Thanks.\\nPeter Haytaian -- President, Carelon and CarelonRx\\nYeah, thanks. Excuse me. Thanks, Dave, for the question. As it relates to 2023 and the growth of around 18.6% that did exceed our initial guidance -- and as you alluded to, that was driven primarily by the BioPlus acquisition and including BioPlus and our results to a lesser extent, drug mix and trends.\\nBut I would say, as it relates to 2024, I would say we have tremendous momentum in the business. And we're really excited about how our strategy is playing through. We've talked about assuming the strategic levers that really matter in our business. We've done that with Specialty Pharmacy and BioPlus.\\nWe've done that with advanced home delivery. You heard about the recent announcement of Paragon, an infusion which we're really excited about. And then there are several new product launches that are resonating in the marketplace that we've talked about previously, like insurer access as one of the examples. And this momentum is playing through in our sales in 2024.\\nWe are having a good season. Obviously, that activity occurred in 2023. Our retention remains strong. Our sweet spot does remain in that 3,000 to 10,000 range in terms of the business that we're attracting.\\nAnd as you know, there's a little more reticence in terms of the larger jumbo accounts moving. But I would say that a couple of notable wins there. We saw a couple of wins in the 20,000 to 50,000 range. So, we're really excited about the momentum in Carelon and what we're doing strategically and how that's playing through in the marketplace.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Pete. Our next question will be our last question.\\nOperator\\nFor our final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\\nGeorge Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nYeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in after Dave. I'm going to come back to MA margins one more time. And I'm going to ask you if you could expand a little bit if there is a way to disaggregate kind of the MA margin expansion thinking about your pricing initiatives versus utilization expectation versus mix and kind of the market exits that you guys have targeted.\\nJust trying to figure if you can kind of maybe rank order the contribution on margin expansion in MA from each of those four initiatives?\\nMark Kaye -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks very much for the question, George. We are not looking to necessarily provide individual margin guidance within the health benefit segment. Certainly, we feel comfortable with where we're guiding to in aggregate for 2024 and the 25 to 50 basis point range. And we think that the qualitative commentary that we provided in the call today should give you enough to get a feel for how the management team is thinking about this.\\nGiven this is my first earnings call, I just want to spend a minute on capital deployment before we close out here. And I just wanted to make the point that I expect to continue with Elevance Health's existing strategic policy around capital deployment, as I believe it really strikes the right balance between growth and the return of capital to our stockholders. And just as a reminder, we are going to target 50% of our free cash flow toward M&A or organic reinvestment and approximately 50% is a return of capital to our stockholders, either via the 30% for share repurchases or the 20% for dividends. And each year may differ, but over the years, we expect to allocate capital consistent with this framework.\\nGail Boudreaux -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Mark. And thank you to everyone who joined us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about our future, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year.\\nThank you again for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through February 23, 2024.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug. \\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Debbie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us to review Shockwave's results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023, which proved to be another banner one for the company. During the year, we launched C2 in Japan. We converted to direct sales forces in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Canada.\\nWe launched two new products, L6 for peripheral vessels and C2+ for the coronaries. We were granted DRG codes specific to coronary IVL in the inpatient hospital setting, which pay on average about $9,000 more than codes for PCIs without IVL. We acquired and integrated Neovasc and the Reducer product, which is the first device that addresses refractory angina, an often debilitating condition that impacts a large patient population that has no good treatment options, and we raised $750 million in a convertible debt offering. We achieved record revenue of $203 million in the fourth quarter, which was a 41% increase from a year ago, and a 9% sequential increase from the third quarter of 2023.\\nOur revenue for the full year of 2023 was $730.2 million, a 49% increase from 2022 revenue. We witnessed excellent performance in all areas of the business, with U.S. peripheral and coronary businesses growing 47% and 41%, respectively, and our international IVL business growing 75% compared to 2022. Really stellar performance.\\nThe team continues to execute at a high level, and we now have over 1,500 global employees. Our products are approved in 70 countries, and we are pleased that we now have EU MDR certification for M5+, S4 and C2+ catheters and our generator. The MDR process was a long journey and required a major effort by the team. Our U.S.\\ncoronary business continues to shine, and we have a couple of meaningful reimbursement tailwinds that will support continued adoption. The new hospital inpatient DRGs for coronary went into effect in the fourth quarter of last year and additionally, physicians are now being paid when they use coronary IVL thanks to the CPT code that became effective on January 1 of this year. As we have witnessed in the past, reimbursement takes time to influence customer behavior, but we anticipate that the combination of these new payments will have a positive impact on our U.S. coronary business and will help lower the economic friction that has historically been the biggest constraint on increased utilization of IVL.\\nWe anticipate that physicians will increasingly use C2+ whenever they feel it's clinically appropriate, versus feeling pressured to only use it selectively or after exhausting all other options. We believe an IVL-first strategy is optimal for patients and is now even better economically for customers. Also on the coronary topic, we are continuing the launch of C2+, which has 50% more pulses than its predecessor C2. Isaac will talk a bit more about this later in the call, but early reception from our customers has been very positive.\\nOn the U.S. peripheral side, the prior authorization issue appears to have stabilized as our customers are learning how to navigate Aetna's increased scrutiny on peripheral procedures, and we have not seen any other payers follow Aetna's practices. Meanwhile, multiple medical societies have come together to form a working group, and they have been applying pressure on Aetna in hopes of getting them to reconsider their policy. There also has been considerable attention paid to Medicare Advantage recently.\\nAt the federal level, CMS recently announced new rules, which will make it harder to pursue prolonged prior authorization practices. There also has been some predictive recent movement among commercial payers specific to Shockwave, as HUMANA, the second largest Medicare Advantage payer, issued a positive coverage decision for IVL for their Medicare Advantage plans effective January 1, 2024. Staying on the topic of U.S. peripheral reimbursement, we are pleased to see that CMS improved hospital reimbursement by assigning peripheral IVL to new MS-DRGs.\\nThese new DRGs increased inpatient hospital payment by $4,000 to $10,000 over previous levels. Most peripheral interventions are performed in an outpatient setting. However, a majority of the hospital-based below-the-knee procedures are for the more severe chronic limb-threatening ischemia or CLTI, which makes them more likely to be performed on an inpatient basis than other procedures. This reimbursement uplift nicely complements the upcoming advances in our below-the-knee product offering that starts later this year.\\nWhile on the topic of new products, we will be focusing back on peripheral in the second half of this year with two launches. First, we will introduce an upgraded version of L6, which will go from one pulse per second to two. We witnessed a very positive response from our customers when we made this same upgrade going from M5 to M5+. Shortly after the L6 rollout, we plan to launch the E8 peripheral catheter.\\nE8 has an eight-centimeter-long treatment zone, which is twice as long as our current S4 offering and is specifically designed to treat longer diffuse lesions that are common and below-the-knee cases. We look forward to seeing our customers' response to E8. We think they're going to love it. Rounding out our future BTK offering, we anticipate the approval of our JAVELIN peripheral catheter in the latter part of the year and look forward to starting the limited market release of that product prior to an expected full market release in early 2025.\\nThat makes three significant new peripheral launches within the next year. And finally, on the operations front. Our facility in Costa Rica has gone from first shovel in the ground in June of 2022 to a validated clean room and C2+ line in December of 2023. Amazing progress, frankly.\\nWe'll be hosting regulatory audits starting this month and anticipate shipping finished product into inventory in the third quarter of this year. 2023 was a great year for Shockwave, and we are even more excited about what lies ahead in 2024. We expect revenue between $910 million to $930 million for the full year of 2024, representing growth of 25% to 27% over 2023. Before I turn the call over to Isaac to provide more color on the commercial front, I want to take a minute to thank our outgoing CFO, Dan Puckett, for the tremendous job he has done in his eight years at Shockwave.\\nDuring his time here, he was instrumental in our growth from a small pre-revenue private company to a public company with over $700 million in revenue. Dan is not only a fantastic CFO, but he is a joy to work with. He's been the biggest cheerleader for all of us, always supportive and inspiring to everyone around him and he will be sorely missed. We wish Dan well in his retirement and are pleased to introduce our new CFO, Renee Gaeta, who is jumping right in today, and will present the financials a bit later in the call.\\nAnd if he gets anything wrong, it's all Dan's fault. With that, I'll turn the call over to Isaac.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nThank you, Doug. Our record results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023 reflect outstanding contributions from our businesses and teams around the globe. Q4 2023 was strong for our U.S. coronary business.\\nRevenue grew 40% compared to Q4 of 2022, 11% sequentially from Q3 of 2023 and 15% sequentially on an average daily sales basis. The C2+ launch is proceeding well. We launched over 1,000 accounts and the product has been very well received. What is particularly appreciated is the utility of more pulses in longer diffuse lesions, eccentric lesions, and calcified nodules.\\nWe expect continued momentum in the coronary business as our sales team focuses on the C2+ launch and on communicating both the favorable reimbursement changes and additional physician fees for using coronary IVL. Revenue from our U.S. peripheral business in Q4 2023 was up 19% from a year ago, flat sequentially compared to Q3 and up 3% sequentially on an average daily sales basis. As Doug mentioned, we are seeing a stabilization of the prior authorization dynamic as providers are getting better at navigating the additional steps required for some patients.\\nWe continue to expect modest growth in the U.S. peripheral business in the first half of 2024 as we maintained a strong focus on the U.S. coronary business. We did anticipate accelerated U.S.\\nperipheral growth in the second half of 2024 with the L6 and E8 product launches. Turning to our international business. We had another record quarter of IVL sales as revenue was up 67% from a year ago, and 14% sequentially compared to Q3. We are now direct in all five major European markets: Germany, the U.K., Spain, Italy, and France.\\nSales in Germany doubled during 2023 due to the improved coronary reimbursement. We are starting to see increased usage in some of the smaller German accounts, which can now afford IVL. Germany is the largest market in Europe, and we think there is tremendous upside for coronary penetration from the current level of just over 2%. We had our first full quarter of direct sales in Italy and are very pleased with the execution by that team.\\nIt feels good to see such strong and seamless execution from the direct selling teams in Europe. We continue to drive penetration with the focus of the Shockwave sales team and the support of our marketing and physician education programs. In Japan, we completed our first year of coronary sales. We exceeded our goals for the number of accounts launched, the penetration in the launched accounts, and revenue.\\nWe have initiated efforts to develop clinical data that will support using IVL in conjunction with atherectomy and drug-coated balloons. We are working closely with CVIT, the interventional cardiology society in Japan, to ensure that IVL is available and appropriately used throughout Japan. In China, we are still experiencing the impact of the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which is slowing IVL adoption at new centers. On the positive side, adoption within centers that had IVL on the pricing list before the anti-corruption campaign started is growing nicely.\\nThat said, we expect very little revenue from China in the first half of 2024. Finally, the European Reducer team posted a very nice quarter. The teams in Germany and France are being rebuilt, and along with the established U.K. team, continue to generate revenue while testing different market development strategies and sales models.\\nWe are very pleased with the integration of Neovasc and are starting 2024 with strong teams in place to both accelerate enrollment in the COSIRA-II trial and build the international Reducer business. With that, I will turn the call to Renee to review the financials.\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Isaac, and good afternoon, everyone. I am thrilled to have joined the Shockwave team and look forward to working with all of you. Shockwave Medical's revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, was $203 million. a 41% increase from $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nU.S. revenue was $158.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 34% from $118.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Coronary products contributed $115.2 million to U.S. revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 40% from $82.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nU.S. revenue from our peripheral products was $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 19% from $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The growth in U.S. revenue during the quarter was driven primarily by increased utilization at existing accounts, supported by our continued sales force expansion.\\nInternational revenue was $44.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a 74% increase from $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Coronary products contributed $37.7 million to international revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, an 83% increase from $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. International revenue from our peripheral products was $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 19% from $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Reducer product contributed $1.8 million to international revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nThe increase in international revenue over the prior year period was driven by a continued geographic expansion, particularly in Japan, the increased productivity of our direct selling teams in Europe and the momentum from our C2+ launch. Looking at product lines, our peripheral products, Shockwave M5, Shockwave M5+, Shockwave S4 and Shockwave L6, accounted for $48.1 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $40.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 19% increase. Our coronary products, Shockwave C2 and Shockwave C2+, accounted for $152.9 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $102.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a 49% increase. Revenue from our Reducer product accounted for $1.8 million of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $177.7 million compared to $126.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 88% for the fourth quarter of 2023, consistent with gross margin of 88% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $134.4 million, a 60% increase from $84.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $67.2 million compared to $43.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nThe increase was primarily driven by sales force expansion. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $42.3 million compared to $23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by head count growth, higher clinical-related expenses, including Reducer, and the facility expansion to support R&D. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $24.9 million compared to $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nThe increase was primarily driven by higher head count to support the growth of the business. Operating margin was 21% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $44.3 million compared to net income of $140.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we released a valuation allowance, which resulted in a tax benefit of $99 million in that quarter.\\nBasic net income per share for the period was $1.20. Diluted net income per share for the period was $1.16. Adjusted EBITDA was $68.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 20% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $56.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, I'd like to briefly recap some highlights from our full year 2023 results.\\nTotal revenue for the full year 2023 was $730.2 million, an increase of 49% compared to full year 2022 revenue of $489.7 million. U.S. revenue for the full year 2023 was $581.5 million, representing a 43% increase over 2022 revenue of $407.4 million. International revenue was $148.7 million for the full year of 2023 compared to $82.3 million in 2022, representing an 81% increase.\\nGross margin for the full year 2023 was 87%, consistent with 87% for the full year 2022. Total operating expenses were $475.7 million in 2023, an increase of 58% compared to operating expenses of $300.6 million in 2022. Operating margin was 22% for the full year 2023. Total net income for the full year 2023 was $147.3 million compared to $216 million for the full year 2022.\\nNet income in 2022 included the $99 million tax benefit from the aforementioned release of our valuation allowance. Basic net income per share was $4.01 for the full year 2023. Diluted net income per share was $3.85 for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $242.7 million for the full year 2023, a 40% increase from adjusted EBITDA of $173.9 million for the full year 2022.\\nLooking forward to 2024, we expect to continue to make significant investments to support and sustain our growth and anticipate full year 2024 operating margin expansion of up to 100 basis points from the full year of 2023. Similar to the pattern we saw in 2023, we do expect a step-down in Q1 operating margin from the prior Q4, reflecting compensation and benefits costs, which reset at the beginning of the year as well as the timing and increased costs related to our global sales meeting held in March. We ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $990.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for closing comments.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Renee, and thank you all for joining us today. 2023 was another great year at Shockwave. The team continues to execute at the highest level as we achieve our mission to help treat underserved patient populations around the globe with our innovative solutions, and we're excited to continue this work in 2024. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Good afternoon. Nice quarter, and congrats on a fantastic year and welcome, Renee, on the new role. I wanted to start on the guidance construction, the top line, $910 million to $930 million.\\nMaybe just talk about what's embedded for some of the different pieces of the business, coronary versus peripheral versus Reducer? And if I heard correctly, you said modest U.S. peripheral growth in the first half of '24, then accelerate in the back half with new product launches. Hoping you could flesh that out some. I'm assuming that's assuming some continued headwinds from Aetna, but wanted to, I guess, kind of understand what's baked into the guide for Aetna prior auths, as well as China anti-corruption.\\nAny potential impact from the step-down in outpatient reimbursement on the coronary side in the back half of the year? I'm sorry for the long-winded question.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. And we'll probably tag team on this. We are anticipating modest growth on peripheral particularly in the first couple of quarters while we concentrate on coronary. And then as we start launching L6 and E8 and turn our focus back to peripheral, we'll start seeing a step up in peripheral growth.\\nThe year will be another really strong year we anticipate for U.S. coronary contribution as a percent of the business. We anticipate U.S. coronary will be actually a larger percent of the total business than it was end of -- throughout the 2023.\\nWe obviously had a very strong international performance last year. We anticipate another strong year, although we have the China deficit. So, ex China, international is going to do very well, but we'll be losing over $10 million in -- somewhere between $10 million and $20 million in revenue that we would have -- that we had last year in China that we're not going to get this year. So, we're anticipating sort of very low single-digit revenue out of China.\\nSo, ex China, another strong contribution year from the international business. And Isaac, I don't know if you --\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nLast point, Adam, you asked about was on the outpatient -- for coronary U.S. in the second half, the outpatient payment? We don't anticipate. I mean, we're aware of the situation, obviously. We still expect baseline is that the TPT will -- is set to expire July 1, and it will expire July 1.\\nWe still anticipate the up leveling to 5194 will occur Jan 1 of 2025, but what we've seen typically with reimbursement in the U.S. is it takes time to move behavior and change behavior patterns and what -- so we've not been on this kind of good, good run in coronary, and we have a really strong coronary business and momentum right now, with the inpatient reimbursement continue to be a tailwind, the physician fee continue to be a tailwind, the C2+ launch is a tailwind, and we just don't anticipate that having the TPT expire in the middle of the year will be much of a headwind, TBD, but that's kind of what we've seen in our -- that's what we've baked into our guidance.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nYeah. That's good color, guys. Thank you for that. And for the follow-up, we'll stick with the guidance topic and switch over to margins.\\nIf I heard correctly, you're expecting up to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion for full year '24 over '23 levels. That's a little bit below kind of where the street is pre call. Maybe I would just love to hear a little bit more about kind of what's embedded in that assumption. Should we be orienting models to kind of 50 basis points kind of the midpoint of that range? Or should we start at 100 basis points kind of coming out of the Q4 call here? And yes, I just would love to hear a little bit more about the philosophy on the leverage piece.\\nThanks so much.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So, we -- as usual, we're going to continue investing in aggressively in our pipeline, both on the sort of hardcore product development side, and increasingly, the clinical trial expenses, which whether it's the trial for Reducer, the COSIRA-II study or the various trials such as DUO that we're running now or EMPOWER. We initiated multiple trials next year and they're becoming more expensive -- last year. And this year, we'll spend even more on those trials.\\nSo, big step-up in clinical spend. We'll continue to augment our global sales footprint, but the U.S. team will not be growing at the same rate that it has historically. We've -- we're not done building out that team, but the rate of change will be lower.\\nSo, the -- so you'll probably see a little leverage on sales, sort of not incremental leverage on R&D. We shouldn't see much deleveraging on R&D, but that will probably be static relative to the top line. We're still spending money right now. We're still having to expense Costa Rica, and that does not convert into inventory until later in the year.\\nAnd so, we're still having to absorb Costa Rica costs, which are not insignificant.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nI got it. And just one clarification, Doug. No change to the 500 basis points operating margin expansion over '23 levels that you outlined at the Innovation Day last year. I just wanted to confirm that's still the case.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. We've been -- we've articulated previously that it's going to be '25, '26. We're pleased that -- if this plan delivers as expected, we're very pleased with up to 100-basis-point improvement. If you want to model 50, I'm perfectly OK with that.\\nAnd we'll obviously try to do better, but we're targeting top-line growth, as our objective, not -- we think the margin improvement is really an output of the business versus the specific objective of the business.\\nAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nThanks for the color.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nHey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of things here. You gave us a little granularity on what you're seeing from Aetna.\\nAnd just what do you think in terms of when this comes back? Is this just like a three-, six-, nine-month delay? Or does this take patients out of the funnel? Or does it come back at some point in time? How should we think about just Aetna going forward?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I'm going to answer this and bring in Rob Fletcher as well to add color. What's unknowable for us is, is a patient -- is an Aetna Shockwave patient that got treated today somebody who would have been treated four months ago, two months ago, one month ago? Don't know. It's impossible for us to have that level of granularity.\\nAnd maybe Rob can talk a bit more about sort of what he's seeing more broadly on -- from our team and from societies on this prior auth.\\nRob Fletcher -- Senior Vice President, Marketing and Market Access\\nYeah, that's right, Bill. I think what typically happens after a change in practice from one of the payers that are out there is what you see is at the provider level, at the hospital level, there's often a reaction to that. They have to do more documentation, or they have to take additional measures or steps or allow for more time to go through a prior authorization process. So, typically, what we see is over time after some initial sort of temporal disruption, people figure out how to start working within this and then they plan for it.\\nAnd then it kind of becomes -- back to a steady state. It's kind of a new normal, but you wind up with more of a steady state type of effect. And I think that's what we're seeing and hearing now from customers is that that has really sort of stabilized. People have figured out how to work within that.\\nMeanwhile, we do see action being taken from the medical societies, for example, who did, over the course of this period, come together. Jointly, there was multiple medical societies, and did issue an additional letter to Aetna that covered a bunch of different things, including this prior authorization practice. So, you are starting to see some pushback, and I expect that Aetna will take that under consideration under many other things. But for the time being, I think it's -- I'd describe it as what appears to be more a stable situation at a new normal.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then as a follow-up, I don't want to leave Renee out on our first conference call. Welcome, Renee. Is -- your other income was significant in the quarter, well above.\\nCan you kind of call out any one-times there for us?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWouldn't necessarily be one-time, but certainly, interest income is within that number and then, of course, our interest expense out on the convertible debt. So, that number is going to be nice, given interest rates currently. And thank you for the question.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nSo, $15.3 million, is that something we should model in going forward?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\n$15.3 million might be a little high. There's probably some FX in there. Yeah. So, it's slightly high, but there's -- just because of the FX for the period, but it is largely interest income.\\nBill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nAmazing. Thank you. Maybe just to hop off on that point. The amount of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, you're approaching $1 billion, so it's nearly as much as is in my checking account.\\nAnd so, I got to ask like what do you like -- updated thoughts? I know there was like a willingness to be sort of strategically footed around M&A., so obviously, it's like nearly an eighth of your market cap. How are you thinking about capital allocation?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd if you want to Venmo me, Patrick, I'm receptive. I'll give you my numbers. So, yes, we continue to be very receptive to smart strategic external opportunities. Maybe emphasis on smart or trying to be smart, at least.\\nWe raised the convert with the -- recognizing that there was a window where valuations for private companies were down, and they still are. It's very hard to raise money for small companies. And valuations have said private companies were -- and willingness of boards sort of had changed over a 12-, 24-month period. And we didn't -- at middle of last year, we did not have the cash wherewithal to make offers on some -- on properties that we might be interested or thought we might be interested in, and we realized that the convert structure and terms were just so attractive that having a 1% coupon in a period where we can -- we're netting a nice interest income relative to our interest expense right now.\\nAnd we didn't raise the money so that we could invest the money, we raised the money so that we could be opportunistic if something came along. That said, the worst thing you could do is just because you have cash, run out and buy something that is not smart to buy. And so, if at the end of the day, we don't see anything that we think is going to be accretive to our growth and accretive to our shareholder value, then we'll sit on the cash until we find something that is worth investing in. That gives us tremendous amount of strategic flexibility that we're -- we feel really fortunate to have for a company at our stage, to be growing at our rate, to be profitable and have this much cash on the books is really -- we recognize the unique position we're in.\\nBut we don't feel obligated to run out and spend that money on something because then we would be more likely to do something that wasn't smart.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nTotally. And maybe as a quick follow-up, the -- slightly more bigger picture, and I know we don't talk about OUS that much, but when do you think you're going to get to a point of a body of clinical evidence that can kind of help unlock some of the penetration in some of the other markets? Obviously, Germany went your way recently, and I know in the U.K., nice sort of reformulated that language around peripheral. But just kind of -- is there like a critical mass of evidence that you feel is needed to unlock the markets? Or is it something else?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nI'll take a shot at that. I think in many of the markets, it's unlikely that at least with our coronary and our peripheral IVL that will amass enough evidence that those systems, kind of the National Health Systems will increase or give extra payment for IVL. I think it's -- those are generally going to need to be large, randomized studies, showing cost effectiveness compared to other products. And we just don't see those studies being necessary, really, one, but also, we're not -- we talked about this a lot internally.\\nWe don't know what to randomize against. Because we don't -- randomizing against the balloon, we don't think is an appropriate study, randomizing against atherectomy, we don't think it's an appropriate study. There are different tools for different clinical situations. So, we're working on it.\\nWe have -- Japan, we're in a good spot. Obviously, Germany, we're in a good spot. Hopefully continue to get better. Our JV is working on regional reimbursement in China, and we'll make progress there.\\nBut I think generally, it's going to be -- IVL is going to be paid for out of kind of hospital funds and the budgets they have to treat to treat patients without any incremental payment for IVL.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWhat will be interesting to see is with COSIRA-II, assuming success in that study, that's exactly the kind of study that the sham-controlled randomized study, again, assuming it works, it will be undeniable that that product does what it was designed to do and actually increases the chances that Reducer could be -- could get reimbursement in some of those systems. And it's a stand-alone procedure versus IVL that drops into existing procedures that are already paid for, so it's harder outside of certain discrete markets like Germany and Japan and the U.S., it's harder to get an incremental payment in those systems because they're kind of not structured to pay more per device, whereas a small subset of countries do pay differentially based on the way they code for different device utilization.\\nPatrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nTotally get it. Thanks so much for taking the questions.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYou're welcome.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHey, thanks for taking the question, and welcome, Renee. Doug, maybe a little bit more color on what modest peripheral growth means. Is that still in the 10% to 15% range? Or is it more low single digits? And is that modest growth every quarter of the year?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nMore modest early. So, low -- we think probably low singles for the first half of the year, stepping up to probably low doubles to teens in the back half of the year.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nOK. Helpful. And then in Q1 -- or sorry, just like in January and February so far, anything to call out on trends in coronary and peripheral? And I'm curious if the total revenue for Q1's still picking up sequentially a little bit.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, on the latter, up a bit sequentially. It was a strong fourth quarter, obviously. We were pleased with the fourth quarter. We're relieved -- not surprised but encouraged that the contagion fear was not realized.\\nWe weren't afraid of contagion from Aetna, but I know a lot of folks who are probably listening to this call we were a little worried that it was going to be multiple payers were going to do what Aetna was doing, and we certainly aren't seeing that. I'd say procedure volumes appear sound. We're not -- we're pleased with what we're hearing from the field.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nOK, great. Thanks a lot for the questions.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYep.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Starting, Doug, in the U.S., U.S. coronary accelerated in Q4.\\nHow much do you think the new DRGs are helping already? And on peripheral, sales were flattish sequentially. Aetna is only 10% to 12% of covered lives, I believe. U.S. peripheral was a growth driver for you.\\nSo, help us understand how Aetna has had so much of an impact? And I had one follow-up.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Aetna was the phenomenon that was the real change that we noted after the sort of mid -- it really took place in September, so end of Q3. carried through into Q4. And when we first -- when we did our call last year, I don't know that we described the underlying sort of slowness of procedures that we were seeing in the third quarter into the fourth quarter for peripheral.\\nSo, it would have been -- we would have been a little soft on peripheral, and then you compounded that with Aetna. I'd say, on balance, peripheral procedures appear to be somewhat less soft, but it's -- so I think we feel more bullish about growth, particularly as we turn focus back to peripheral. Right now, we're -- for good reason, with two reimbursement changes, a new product launch, we really want to maximize on our coronary opportunity. And then when we have three product launches in a row in peripheral we'll be spending a lot of time on peripheral.\\nSo, we're anticipating peripheral will contribute much more nicely to growth end of '24 into '25, and high hopes for JAVELIN to be a major contributor to that end as well. So, we're -- you're not wrong. Aetna is a 10% to 20% player on the -- in the matrix of all the private payers. So, it wasn't just an Aetna phenomenon, but Aetna, clearly, was a meaningful -- had a meaningful impact, but it wasn't the entirety of the impact on the peripheral volume in the back end of last year.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nAnd Doug, sorry, the first part of the question was the acceleration in U.S. coronary. Was this -- the strength in the quarter came from U.S. coronary.\\nHave you started to see an impact from the new DRGs already? And I'll ask my follow-up, Doug. There's a late breaker at ACC on Neovasc this ORBITA-COSMIC. How is it different from COSIRA-II? And is there any read-through from that trial to what we might see in COSIRA-II? Thank you.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's really hard to -- well, generally, as we say consistently on reimbursement because it's what we've observed, it's a dimmer switch not an on and off switch, so it has an effect gradually over time. And we launched C2+ and we got the uplift simultaneously. It certainly doesn't -- it did not hurt at all. It will always be impossible to disaggregate new product launch and reimbursement that happened simultaneously, and it's now going to be even harder because now we've got the CPT goods.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nYeah. I'll just pile on to that, Larry. What we talked about in the past, what the inpatient -- I think especially the inpatient uplift in the DRG, what it does ultimately is as the hospitals see the income coming in, it helps the cath lab budget get relaxed. And so, the cath lab then puts less pressure on physicians to moderate their use.\\nThey can -- physicians then feel like they use IVL when it's appropriate and they're not getting pushback from cath lab administrators. And that takes time. I was at an account earlier this week in Santa Cruz, and that was the input from them. They just don't -- they're not getting push back from the administration anymore.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd on ORBITA-COSMIC, we certainly are delighted to see multiple data sets for Reducer at ACC. That's encouraging. We don't know the results from that study. It's small, 50-ish patients, so it's not going to be powered to make any conclusions about it.\\nThey use MRI as an endpoint, so really unclear if that's a -- I see that as a feasibility of that tool versus something that's going to be just positive about the Reducer. I won't be surprised if you see that patients' symptoms are better because that's what we see consistently in the various studies that have been done on Reducer and what we see anecdotally from all the users in Europe. Whether you really learn anything, that is a read-through to COSIRA-II because we don't use MRI as an endpoint in COSIRA-II, so I don't know that that's going to really be informative on potential outcome of the COSIRA-II study. If the patients feel better in the treatment arm, that bodes well for COSIRA-II, I guess, could be the one takeaway.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask on the outpatient coronary reimbursement topic with an eye toward the map to 5194. Kind of two-parter.\\nThe event path from here, and then a question on coding. So, is this event path simply we wake up in July, we see the proposal and we see what we see? Or do you have an opportunity to engage with CMS here through this spring that might give you a better feel for how they're looking at this? And the second piece is on coding. I think we're operating under the assumption that this winds up getting solved with the complexity adjustment using the new CPT code that was in effect Jan 1, '24. Is that correct? Or is there potentially another to-be-determined coating solution here?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. It would be a waste if I try to answer this one. Rob's sitting right next to me, so I'll let Rob take this one.\\nRob Fletcher -- Senior Vice President, Marketing and Market Access\\nYeah. I think the -- so as part of normal course of business, we do get on CMS' calendar as they start to make -- they get into their rule-making cycle. And so, certainly, we have met with CMS, again, about this issue and the issue of the transitional pass-through and so on and so forth. So, I think your first question was what's the normal course of business and the sort of things that happen.\\nAnd the first thing that happens is that you sort of talk with CMS prior to them making the rule, drafting the rule, about your issue at hand. And so, that's happened. I think the things that we see from here, yes, I would mainly point the next sort of public available information is likely going to be the proposed rule, which happens in early July. So, we won't sort of see or hear much in the public domain between now and then.\\nSo, hopefully, Mike, that got that part of the question. I think your second part of the question, or your second question, was just around the mechanism that would proceed here. And I think you've identified it correctly that here, what we're talking about as a complexity adjustment that's based on an add-on code, a procedure add-on code, and that's the normal vehicle by which if you have an add-on code in structure, that's how you get increased payment, is then you then sort of qualify -- certain combinations of code qualify for complexity adjustment, and that's exactly sort of what we're looking at here. And as for on this call and others, this is where we have a very large volume of data associated with that.\\nWe have sort of strong confidence in these combinations of codes and then qualifying for complexity adjustment.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nThat was a great, Rob, on both fronts. And the brief follow-up is maybe back to Doug. I think, Doug, on several instances, you've suggested maybe 95% confidence in the outcome here of kind of achieving 5194 in 2025 and beyond. Is 95% still how you feel about this?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nI do not feel less confident. I wish CMS, when Rob met with them, said, you're right, we're going to do it. But they don't say those things. They just look blankly at Rob.\\nAnd every time we meet, and usually, we get a good outcome. And this time, I think the facts are pretty clearly pointing in the direction of moving to 5194.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nHelpful. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions, and welcome, Renee. You called out 2% penetration in Germany. Can you just give us a sense of where you are in terms of penetration within key accounts? And what have you seen in terms of how utilization has scaled early on, and what procedure volumes look like in some of the top accounts?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. We have -- I think even in the top accounts in Germany, the penetration is still relatively low. What happens in Germany when there isn't sufficient payment to cover the cost of a product, there's a very tight linkage between the hospital administration and the physician's behavior in Germany, tighter than I think anywhere else except Japan. So, what happens is the physicians will use the product until the administration tells them to stop and then they stop.\\nSo, you'd get the cyclical -- an account using the product, and then it would just turn off in September. Or they'd use the product and then the administration will come back the next year and say, \\\"Hey, you used 50, you only get 25 this year.\\\" And so, the product utilization will get curtailed. And then at smaller accounts, it would essentially be zero because they just didn't have enough money within the hospital system to cover these extra costs and the administration would clamp down. So, we really have a lot of headroom in Germany, not just gaining adoption in smaller accounts, which is kind of a zero base in those accounts but then really driving appropriate use and adoption at the larger accounts where it was being curtailed by the administration.\\nDoes that answer your question?\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nYeah, it's perfect. I mean, just one separate follow-up. It looks like on COSIRA-II, the CT.gov is giving you a primary completion date of June 2024, but I just wanted to double check on how we should think about the timing there and when we could see those results.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, we need to update that.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nI don't think we've touched that since the acquisition, so that was not a realistic timeline ever.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. That was the prior company's timeline. Yes. Right now, if you recall, we're forecasting approval in '27.\\nYou got to back up from there for submission and review of a PMA, and then that puts your enrollment completion somewhere second half of '25 is a much more realistic timeline. And the team is doing a really exceptional job of getting sites up. There was a paucity of sites that had been started, and many of those sites weren't really probably the right sites to choose to get rapid enrollment. So, our team, once they took over, have gotten the trial on the rails, but it's a sham-controlled trial with a really rigorous enrollment criteria, inclusion criteria, which is why every time we show clinicians the trial design, they universally say if, and we would say when, when that study is successful, it's -- it will be irrefutable that that device works.\\nSo, rigorous trial makes it hard to enroll. A rigorous trial also results in much more valuable data for market creation and -- inclusive of reimbursement.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nThat's super helpful. Thanks very much.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nYeah, thanks. Just a couple on the new peripheral products, so E8 and JAVELIN. I can't remember if you had said anything about the pricing on those products at the Investor Day you did in the fall, but can you give us any sense there on where those things would be priced? And then with JAVELIN, I mean, am I thinking about it the right way that that's something that could drive more revenue per procedure, because they would likely use that to kind of cross a lesion and then you follow that up with one of the regular catheter -- or sorry, balloons?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nIf we said anything about price, it would have been something along the lines of we will determine the price when we get closer to launching the product, and that would still be what I would say now. Thus far, we try to make sure that we deliver really clinically meaningful new devices to our customers and price them in a way that we think is -- enables the customers to have a good financial outcome and for us to reflect the value of the technology. In terms of JAVELIN, there likely will be some cases where you use JAVELIN plus, JAVELIN plus E8, JAVELIN plus M5+, but we -- what we've witnessed thus far is that the power of the lithotripsy shock waves is not just cracking in a sort of forward effect to get you through the difficult to cross lesions, but it also has a radial effect, which enables you to then follow JAVELIN with standard balloon angioplasty. And so, our expectation is that the vast majority of cases will be JAVELIN plus POBA versus JAVELIN plus another IVL product.\\nAt some juncture, you start to get yourself in a challenging situation with your customers if you load too many IVL products into a single procedure. It just becomes less economically attractive for them. So, we're -- our expectation is that, for the most part, JAVELIN is going to be a JAVELIN plus other, JAVELIN plus balloon.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nOK. That makes sense. And then just as far as Costa Rica goes, I understand that there's some kind of start-up costs and whatnot in the near term, but is that something that you expect to have a material benefit to your gross margins over time?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have chosen to date to manufacture in one of the highest cost places in America, in Santa Clara. So, we do expect that our cost of goods will come down in Costa Rica. So, we've not forecast how many points will pick up out of Costa Rica, but cost of doing business there in every respect is going to be lower than -- other than materials cost, is going to be lower in every respect than what we have right now in Santa Clara.\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nYeah. Just important to remember, though, that for 2024, the product we sell will be manufactured in Santa Clara, so we won't see any benefit to gross margin in 2024.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. We'll put product into inventory this year, but it won't hit customers until '25.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nYeah, I understand. So, there'll definitely be a benefit yet to be quantified, I guess, for '25 and beyond.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nDo you agree?\\nRenee Gaeta -- Chief Financial Officer\\nCorrect. Yeah. I would certainly expect gross margins to be steady for this year. And then in the long run, we will see an improvement given the structure set up.\\nMike Matson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\\nOK, great. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First, on Japan, I'm wondering if you can just sort of give us any sort of metrics on where you are in that launch in terms of what percentage of the 1,200 or so cath labs there that you're in now at this stage of the launch?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. So, the -- again, very, very good year for the team in Japan. It's a relatively small team, and they were incredibly productive in 2023. Based on the guidelines that we worked with, that Shockwave worked with CVIT, the cardiovascular society in Japan, to establish, we are currently limited to hospitals that do a certain number of atherectomy procedures.\\nSo, those tend to be larger hospitals, obviously, with surgical backup. There's also some limitations on, because of the way the trial data we have, we don't have trial data of Shockwave followed by de novo DCB, and de novo DCB is approved in Japan. We don't have trial data of Shockwave after atherectomy, Rota-Shock, for instance. So, part of the work we're doing, it started last year, and we'll be going on in earnest this year and the following years, is to create clinical data to support the use of Shockwave with de novo DCB, to support the use of Rota-Shock, Shockwave with atherectomy.\\nAnd then as we gather more and more data, work with CVIT to show that the product can be safely used in smaller centers, in centers without surgical backup. And as you'll recall, we have that kind of stamp of approval in the U.S. from SCAI already. So, there is -- there's basically a certain number of centers that we have agreed with CVIT that we cannot access until we generate more data, and we're generating those data now.\\nSo, with the centers that we really can access, which account for probably 75% of the PCI in Japan, we're over 50% launched. Or sorry, we've launched over 50% of those centers, and we'll launch the remaining ones in 2024.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And what about the peripheral IVL side in Japan? What's the latest timeline there?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nWe haven't disclosed the timeline yet. We're working right now with the PMDA to establish the regulatory path, and then once that's done kind of first half of this year, we hope to have the path established, then we'll start lining out the timing and the -- or the steps and the timing to get there. And at some point, we'll tell you what that is.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And then one more international question on India. Obviously, a massive PCI market. Can you just remind us where you are there at this stage and how you're thinking about that opportunity over the next few years?\\nIsaac Zacharias -- Chief Commercial Officer\\nSure. We have a distributor in India. We established the distributor in 2020. We launched coincident with coronavirus in February 2020, so the -- as that country has kind of gone through some ups and downs like the rest of the world, we've gotten a good footprint in India through a distributor.\\nWe've generated really nice post-market data in India, post-market registry over 1,000 patients, all comers, core lab adjudicated. Those were presented at -- those data were presented at TCT last fall, and we continue to have really nice momentum, particularly on coronary in India.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And then just one very quick pipeline question. Have you guys started human cases with the aortic lithotripsy product yet?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have not. No.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nAny estimated timeline on that?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThis year.\\nImron Zafar -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nThis year. OK, perfect. OK. Thank you very much.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYep.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy. Please proceed with your question.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end to the year.\\nDoug, I was going to ask about C2+. How are you seeing that being adopted? I know it's early days. You said feedback has been good, but are you seeing it motivate more physicians to pick up IVL and do vessel prep in their patients? Or is it right now more about existing users, treating more patients, and accessing those tougher to treat patients?\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I'd say it's more adoption existing users versus new users. And that's -- and more adoption is going to be the -- with all of the different tailwinds we have, reimbursement and technology tailwinds followed by another technology upgrade next year, it's really finding ways to help people who use -- shift from 4% to 10% and from 10% to 20%, helping give them a good reason to use Shockwave more than they already do. Those who don't use the device yet are in the minority and less of a -- sort of much less opportunity for us to drive growth with, because they're probably also pretty low-volume operators.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nOK. And that was kind of my -- one of my follow-up questions. You already touched on it, on existing users who both do IVL, and all of the patients previously know that there is a large number of patients that have severe disease and treating all of them, so they aren't picking a party to use. Why are they --\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nSo, your phone made it tricky to interpret your question, but I'm going to -- I'll restate your question as best I can, and you tell me if I'm wrong. So, what is the impediment to increase use of IVL or physicians?\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nSorry about that.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo, that's OK. It just makes it a little more challenging. So, the biggest reason historically has been, a, is the economic concern. We have a premium device that we priced at a level that we thought both reflected the value and would ultimately lead to a strong reimbursement position that would be beneficial to the hospital.\\nThankfully, the work Rob and team did was successful. We were successful in securing our own DRGs, which were shocking, on the coronary side, CPT code, and we think ultimately will also yield sort of landing in the highest APC level for coronaries. But the initial reaction to the price was, oh, this is a high-priced device, and there was a lot of anxiety with TPT. That's a little unusual in terms of a reimbursement mechanism, and so there's always been a perception among physicians that we're not really reimbursed even though we have been.\\nSo, there's always been a reluctance in many physicians' hands and minds to -- like I'll only use Shockwave when I absolutely have to because it's an expensive device. So, now that the first two of the three building blocks for eliminating that economic anxiety with the DRGs and CPT code are in place, we think this year will be the first year where a lot of that economic anxiety is ameliorated. The second, another reason why they have been reluctant historically is I've got this long diffuse lesion. You're going to -- I'm going to have to pull two catheters to treat it.\\nMaybe I'll just use atherectomy instead of Shockwave. C2+ addresses that long diffuse reluctance. It also helps diffuse the sort of misperception that Shockwave is less effective on eccentric or nodular calcium. So, now, we give you more power, you can treat those eccentric lesions with one catheter.\\nSo, those are really two of the big headwinds we had faced, the biggest being the economics. And then ultimately, the -- I think the last -- one of the sort of next hurdles that we'll knock down is the our device is very deliverable, but it's not as deliverable as physicians would like. So, there are times when they choose not to pull it because it's bulkier than a regular angioplasty balloon. So, I'll just use something else.\\nThat's a 2025 fix that we'll have with Arrow. So, we've got -- each year, we'll be knocking down the remaining -- some of the remaining pressure points that have capped utilization, and we think we'll just keep uncapping utilization each year.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- SVB Securities -- Analyst\\nThank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThere are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to Doug Godshall for closing remarks.\\nDoug Godshall -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks so much, and thanks, everybody, for your time and attention. Looking forward to another great year in 2024 and delighted to have Renee on board. Look forward to chatting with you all as the year progresses.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the DexCom fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. My name is Abby, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.\\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Sean Christensen, vice president of finance and investor relations.

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin. \\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2023 was an incredible year for DexCom, and I'd like to start by reviewing some of our key accomplishments. Total revenue grew by 24% on an organic basis, driven by another year of record customer starts. This translates into more than $700 million of organic revenue growth compared to last year, as we built strong commercial momentum through recent coverage expansion and the performance of DexCom's CGM systems.\\nIn 2023, we added over 600,000 DexCom users to our base and ended the year with approximately 2.3 million customers globally. Importantly, we delivered this level of growth again while enhancing scale and efficiency of our operations. A key milestone here was the opening of our Malaysia manufacturing facility around midyear. Production at this site is ramping quickly, and the team is already delivering yields on par with our more established U.S.\\nfacilities. This facility will help support our growth and cost ambitions for years to come. As a measure of our success for 2023, we not only generated $1 billion in Q4 revenue, we also delivered $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the year and generated record levels of free cash flow, which is up nearly 70% compared to 2022. By establishing a disciplined cost culture that focuses years in advance, we are striking the right balance of margin progression, while still investing strategically in pathways to support our significant growth opportunities.\\nFrom a strategic perspective, 2023 will go down as one of the most transformational years in our company's history. We launched G7 and Dexcom ONE into multiple new markets significantly expanding our global access and advancing key technical and clinical work that will provide the foundation for the future of DexCom. This started with the rollout of G7 in the U.S. in February.\\nG7 is the most accurate CGM ever launched and the market's reception to G7 has been exceptional. Customers and clinicians have been thrilled with the new form factor, product performance, and ease of use and payers wasted no time establishing coverage as they recognize the clear value proposition that G7 provides. We immediately started to see a change in prescribing patterns once this product reached the market. And this trend became even more pronounced as we completed the largest expansion of coverage in our company's history.\\nIn mid-April, Medicare coverage went live for people with type 2 diabetes, using basal insulin only, as well as certain non-insulin-using individuals with hypoglycemia risk. Between this decision and the broad commercial coverage that quickly followed for the basal markets, we have effectively doubled our reimbursed population in the U.S. This has completely changed the market landscape in the U.S. With broader coverage available and a new product that greatly simplifies the prescribing process, we've attracted a sizable new cohort of clinicians to our ecosystem.\\nIn fact, in 2023, we expanded our prescriber base by approximately 40%, and we're not stopping there. We have always known that the primary care channel would become increasingly important as our business evolves. Much of the work our commercial team has done in recent years has been tailored to this market. And we are now seeing the direct result of that effort as more than 70% of our new scripts are being written by primary care physicians.\\nThese relationships are not only critical to help us reach the millions of insulin-using individuals who have not yet started on CGM but also the tens of millions with broader type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and beyond. Based on the success of our team in 2023 and the magnitude of these future opportunities, we are excited to continue our investment in our U.S. sales force this year. When we have a presence with prescribers, we win.\\nNow, it is up to us to continue to expand that prescriber pool. We are already seeing more clinicians want to incorporate Dexcom CGM earlier into patients' care plans as they recognize our unique ability to drive behavior change, sustainable outcomes, and greater accountability. This is why we are thrilled to be introducing our newest product, Stelo, later this summer. Stelo will be the first CGM designed specifically for people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin.\\nLeveraging our leading sensor platform, we have built a custom software experience that is tailored to the needs of this population. Stelo will feature a 15-day wear time and launches a cash pay product while we build our case with payers for broader coverage. With several trials currently underway, we will continue to add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating DexCom's unique ability to drive greater health and economic outcomes for all people with diabetes. The launch of Stelo also presents a great opportunity to bolster our evidence with a large collection of real-world data as we see the impact this product is having on our customers.\\nWe filed Stelo with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, leaving us well on track for our highly anticipated launch this summer. As our product portfolio continues to grow, it provides a greater glimpse into the future potential of our company. We have built a platform technology that we can customize to provide creative solutions for different populations. Our redesigned software infrastructure is a key component to this, as it enables much quicker iteration and greater connectivity.\\nConnectivity has always been a distinct advantage for DexCom. And with our recent filing of direct-to-watch with the FDA and new G7 pump integrations, we are further advancing this leadership position. We will also continue innovating on our hardware technology, with our current efforts focused on launching an extended wear sensor across all of our product offerings. As we look at the significant opportunity ahead of us, we are as excited as we've ever been.\\nAs I said at our Investor Day this past summer, we are just getting started. With that, I will now turn it over to Jereme for a review of the fourth-quarter financials. Jereme?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.035 billion, compared to $815 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis.\\nAs a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $769 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $606 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27%. Between the ongoing success of G7 and our significantly improved access in recent months, the momentum in our U.S.\\nbusiness continues to grow. In fact, we delivered our fastest quarterly U.S. growth rate since the beginning of 2021 as our revenue accelerated for the third quarter in a row. International revenue grew 27%, totaling $265 million in the fourth quarter.\\nInternational organic revenue growth was 23% for the fourth quarter. We continue to execute very well across our international footprint and again took share in Q4 as our global access work and product portfolio strategy have helped broaden our reach in many markets. Our fourth-quarter gross profit was $664 million or 64.2% of revenue, compared to 66.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year decline in gross margin was expected as G7 was a much larger percent of our product and customer mix in Q4, compared to a year ago.\\nAs a reminder, G7 has a higher cost profile than G6 today but we expect this to change in the coming quarters as we drive greater volume through our G7 lines. As it reaches scale, we continue to expect G7's margin profile to improve upon that of our G6 platform. Operating expenses were $421 million for Q4 2023, compared to $372 million in Q4 of 2022. This quarter was another demonstration of our commitment to being disciplined and thoughtful with our spend.\\nOur operating expenses grew at half the rate of revenue this quarter, and we delivered nearly 500 basis points of operating expense leverage compared to last year. This extended our streak to eight straight quarters of at least 250 basis points of year-over-year opex leverage. Operating income was $242.7 million or 23.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $172.1 million or 21.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million or 31.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $237.1 million or 29.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nNet income for the third quarter was $202.8 million or $0.50 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the year with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Having financial flexibility allows the organization to take advantage of opportunities. Case in point, we executed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program mentioned on our Q3 results.\\nThrough this transaction, we were able to offset the remaining dilution related to our maturing 2023 converts, while purchasing our stock at what we view as an attractive price. As Kevin mentioned earlier, our free cash flow grew by 70% in 2023 as our business continues to scale and become more efficient. As our cash flow profile continues to grow, it only adds to our significant financial flexibility. This allows us to continue to invest behind our meaningful organic growth opportunity while assessing strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis.\\nTurning to 2024 guidance. As we stated last month, we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.35 billion, representing organic growth of 16% to 21% for the year. This guidance assumes continued momentum in the type 2 basal-only population in the U.S., the expansion of Dexcom ONE on the G7 platform into new geographies, and the launch of Stelo in the summer of 2024. It also assumes the divestiture of our non-diabetes distribution business in Australia and New Zealand this quarter, which represented around $30 million of revenue in 2023.\\nFrom a margin perspective, we expect full-year non-GAAP gross profit margin to be in a range of 63% to 64%. Operating profit margin to be approximately 20% and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 29%. Our gross margin guidance reflects the ongoing conversion from G6 to G7 within our customer base and the associated scale that comes with that process. Below gross margin, we'll continue to be very diligent with our spend in 2024, while investing strategically behind multiple growth opportunities.\\nWith that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\\nSean Christensen -- Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then reenter the queue if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you. Well now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. I'll offer up for the second time congrats on a really good quarter. I wanted to tie two ideas together. The first is the great operating margins we saw in the fourth quarter, came in well above the street.\\nAnd in the slide deck presentation, you have the slide about making progress on the 15-day sensor. And the question here is really, one, any updates on the time frame of when that G-Series 15-day sensor will be approved? And how to really think about where that could take the good operating margins you put up here and what you've guided for next year and where that could really take it in the future? Thanks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Robbie. This is Kevin. I'll take the 15-day sensor timing, and then Jereme can talk about the numbers and the effect on operating margins going forward. As we've said earlier this year, we're in the middle of clinical testing and scientific evaluation of some fundamental science changes to the sensor, that will make it more reliable for that 15-day period.\\nOne of the reasons that we've done so well, two things: the accuracy of our sensor and the performance of our sensor over time but combined with the fact people expect to get a certain amount of days from a sensor and we deliver what we tell them we're going to do. And we want to make sure that 15-day experience is every bit as good as the 10-day experience that we offer now. So, we're making a few slight changes on a science basis. We'll run a clinical study, file that, and we certainly would expect to get approved.\\nBut right now, we're still evaluating some of the technologies. And we really won't provide a lot of color until we're filed, and we see we're on a path toward approval.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. And then to your question longer term on operating margins, we've done a really nice job to date, creating leverage and opportunities within our operating margin profile. And despite some of the moves in the channel mix changes we've made on the top line, we've been able to maintain a gross margin, based on a lot of the work we've done around design to value and a lot of the scale that we've been able to achieve. But when you think about 15-day, it provides a real big opportunity for us to think about both leverage from a gross margin and then operating margin profile, but also opportunities to grow the business in areas profitably that maybe it would be a little bit more of a challenge with the 10-day product.\\nSo, it is absolutely the No. 1 effort going on in the organization. It does provide us lots of flexibility to either, a, continue to grow the business; or b, deliver operating margins that can be world-class over time. So, I think longer term, there's a lot of opportunities there.\\nWe're not ready to particularly lay out what that is. We've obviously given our 2025 LRP. And we'll execute to that, but I do think it provides real long-term opportunities for this company to deliver back to shareholders and take advantage of opportunities globally.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong end to the year.\\nIt's great to see. I'm going to ask this question about -- we're hearing more about potential competition coming to market. And I would just love, Kevin, if maybe you could highlight for us the competitive moats that DexCom has built. Obviously, we don't know much about what this competitor is planning to bring to market.\\nBut maybe if you could just highlight where you think DexCom is from a competition perspective and how defensible your share is here. Thanks so much.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, I appreciate that question. First and foremost, we can start with the core technology and the fundamental beliefs we've had here as a company. The performance of our centers has been unparalleled. We've got over 1 million years, for example, and AID systems with great outcomes and patients who have done very well there.\\nWe've built our platforms on connectivity. One of the features that I've talked with the engineers about and kind of complained about because it took a lot of time to engineer. We can connect up to three devices at the same time. This is the type of connectivity that our competitors have not put into their platforms, and it's a feature that's very important to our patients, which is the reason, for example, why we just filed our direct-to-watch features with the FDA.\\nOne of the other things our competition thinks about as they look at us today, and they think this is where we're going to stay. We're not. We certainly have new pipeline efforts across all fronts on the technology side, better connectivity communications, software investments. We've had to evolve from being literally a medical device software company to being a world-class software organization over the past couple of years.\\nAnd it has been an evolution for us and it's been a big investment. So, we've looked at the areas to invest to make ourselves stronger and made investments there. Now, that's on the technology side. Here's the other piece of this.\\nWe've spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years, getting fully automated factories up and running both here in the United States and our new factory in Malaysia that opened midyear, and that is a tremendous facility. But we built out those automated lines there, and we just turned ground on what will be our next world-class factory over in Ireland that would open in 2026. There's a huge investment that has to be made to play in the CGM business going forward, particularly at the scale and the performance that we see now. And we've made those investments and done those things and evolved as a company.\\nSo, we think we're very well positioned, and we'll see where everybody else comes. But we're comfortable. Well, let me rephrase that, we're never comfortable. But we believe we've done all the right things.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Yeah. I wanted to focus on Stelo.\\nYou expect this product to add approximately, I think, 100 basis points to your growth in '24, which is almost $40 million in six months. So, that's a pretty healthy number for only half a year. Kevin, what's informing your confidence in the launch? How big could this product be over time? And what are the margin implications? Thank you.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nLarry, thanks for the question. And we have guided at 1%. The purpose of this launch is to get this product out here and learn. And as we look at that 1% of revenue number, we certainly have models that build and support that.\\nAnd we believe in designing this product for the type 2 non-insulin user and others that we're targeting the right segment to go after that. Our most important experience with Stelo is learning and getting it out there and starting to develop and grow this new market. We're confident that this product over time can become a very, very large portion of our business, and this can be a very large segment within our markets. This year's launch is all about learning more than anything else.\\nAnd we have a model for that 1%. I would love to exceed it. But if we learn all the lessons that we need to learn, this is not a backbreaker for our company and our guidance either. So, the most important thing is to get the product out there and to learn more than anything else.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. And then to your question on margin, we're not necessarily talking about it from a gross margin perspective. That will come in time, when we start to release more details around it, Larry. From an operating margin, yes, this is something we're going to invest in.\\nAnd so, when you think about it from an overall company margins, certainly, as we invest in this and we invest in launching it, there will be some sales and marketing, but it's an investment we're going to make this year. And we're going to make that investment in this product because we believe in the future, and we're going to do so and still expand operating margins as a company. So, you can be safe that we're going to be very, very careful and measured about how we invest our dollars, but know that this is part of the investments we've set aside as an organization while still, again, improving profitability.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open.\\nMathew Blackman -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate you taking my question. Maybe for Kevin and Jereme, you obviously mentioned sales force and the PCP channel. Can you just remind us, at least today, what kind of PCP sales force coverage you have? And then more importantly, sort of leaning into your comments, Kevin, about investing, seemingly incrementally in that channel this year.\\nWhat does that mean in terms of spend magnitude, spend timing? And how much more coverage are you expecting to add with these investments or any other way to frame what you're trying to accomplish? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, thanks for the question, Matt. So, when you think about the investment, we are going to expand that sales force. And today, we have a good amount of coverage.\\nIt's tens of thousands of primary care physicians and predominantly the entirety of the endocrinologist space. But as you start to think about basal coverage expanding, the opportunity ahead of us certainly Stelo out on the horizon, we found there was an opportunity to continue to expand. And as we know, CGM, specifically Dexcom CGM, can play a very important role in how folks manage their diabetes. We know that having those call points is helpful.\\nSo, we are going to expand, and you can take a look at LinkedIn for the amount. There's quite a few openings out there, in terms of the size of it. So, we'll expand our sales force, and we will get more coverage. In terms of the cadence, the LinkedIn -- recs are out there right now, so you'll see us hire over the course of the first quarter.\\nObviously, then the fully loaded burden associated with those reps will take place over the back half of the year, so Q2 through Q4. So, that's how to think about the cadence of that. But again, that's all contemplated in the overall guidance we've provided, the 20% operating margin. So, expect it as part of typical work that we do around creating leverage in the business and investing where we need to.\\nBut if you're thinking about it for a cadence over the course of the year, expect the hires to be made over the course of the first quarter. And then for folks to ramp up and be part of our run rate really Q2, through the balance of the year.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question here on international.\\nI think you've reminded us that you'll be selling a non-CGM business in Australia and also going direct in Japan. I wanted to understand the cadence for Q1 versus the rest of the year. And also, any sort of comments you could make on G7, being on the Dexcom ONE platform? Just an all-around international question there.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks, Marie. And we'll give you some context. So, the non-CGM business, that effectively is gone at this point.\\nSo, that's why we've been comfortable pulling it out and talking about it to organic. So, this quarter, you can expect -- we talked about $30-ish million last year. The math on that, you can kind of do the allocation by quarter. That's out as of this point, for the most part.\\nAnd so, think about that in the quarter, Japan certainly a similar type thing. We talked about it in Q4 being effectively nil. I'd expect a similar contribution in the first quarter. And then as we start to take that book of business or that business live in the second quarter and expect it to start to contribute, as we build that business back up over the course of the year.\\nSo, those are really the international kind of timing. So, Q1 will be the heaviest burden, in terms of as we transition through that. As it pertains to Dexcom ONE on G7, great news is, I think we press released it a couple of days ago, four countries have launched. And so, that has come out.\\nIt is now out there today. Those four countries our first foray, and we're getting great feedback from early adopters within those countries. The expectation is we have a cadence of launches of Dexcom ONE on a G7 form factor, really over the course of the year. So, I'd expect a lot more press releases around where and when we're launching that but expect that to really take place over the course of the year, which gives us a lot of confidence again in Dexcom ONE being a really incredible growth driver for the long term.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.\\nJeff Johnson -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\\nHey, guys, good afternoon. Maybe I'll just keep it on that international point. I think this is the first quarter in a while we've seen international growth below the U.S. growth.\\nAnd if I look back the last few quarters, I think you've gone 40%, 30%, 23% here on the organic growth rate. Just help us understand kind of where that international versus U.S. growth might settle out here in 2024. Would we expect them to be similar to each other? Does International continue to slow for any reason? And as I think about some of the competitive AID approvals that have happened over in Europe, especially with one of your -- with a competitive CGM.\\nJust how are you thinking about the stability of your maybe installed base on the AID side over there versus win rate for new AID systems there? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Hey, thanks, Jeff. So, as you think about the cadence -- so thanks for the question on international. As you think about the cadence over the course of the year, certainly Q4 was buoyed by a few different -- or way down, I guess, I'd say, by a few different things.\\nWe talked a little bit about earlier about the Japan business and really the revenues were effectively nil as we make that transition. And so, that's a negative grower in the quarter. And then the non-diabetes business was really flat. And so, when you think about the business being historically a pretty significant grower, those pull you down.\\nAs you start to exclude those things, we are still growing quite well. In fact, all of the core businesses where we operate today, U.K., Germany, Australia, etc., all continue to grow relatively consistently between Q2, Q3, Q4. There are just some ebbs and flows. But for the most part, those all should do well.\\nSo, then you think about what does that mean going forward? We haven't changed our stance that the OUS business, the international business as a percentage of revenue by the end of 2025 will be bigger than it is today, about two-thirds/one-third, where that split today is more like 70/30 or 72/28. So, I think on the whole, expect the international business with all of the opportunity out there, with certainly the underpenetration we have today, to grow faster than that of the U.S. business over the coming years. That's not to say that we're not incredibly bullish on the U.S.\\nbusiness. Look, if we can outperform on both of those, we'll do the work on both. But at least that's in our LRP. As you think about competitive systems and AID, we are highly confident in what we have to offer.\\nOur product, there's multiple different reasons why we believe our product is special in that space. Kevin alluded to a little bit about it earlier around Bluetooth connectivity is one. I'll just give you an example there. Someone can be on a pump, can talk to their phone, and can be on a direct-to-watch application, all while on our product.\\nNo one else can offer that. We are the only one that can do that. And as you think about this population, which really needs and deserves, quite frankly, the technology to manage their diabetes, we believe that that is a differentiator and a meaningful differentiator going forward. Add to that the millions and millions of years that we're compiling on these systems, we feel highly confident that when we sit in front of a physician, we sit in front of an endocrinologist and we sit in front of a parent, a child that needs an AID system, we feel confident that we are the choice.\\nWe'll continue to battle and make sure that that message continues to go out there. But as we think about that international book of business, we continue to feel very confident even post launch of a competitive system, we'll do incredibly well there.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.\\nMatt Taylor -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could update us on the cadence of data that we could expect to see this year, not only around -- you mentioned before, GLP-1 data that could come from you or from investigators. And then also on Stelo, are we going to see anything on that at upcoming conferences or from you before, during, or after the launch?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo. This is Kevin. I'll take that. We don't really -- we don't need a clinical trial for Stelo as far as getting that product approved.\\nThere is a lot of data on use of continuous glucose monitoring, particularly DexCom systems in this type 2 diabetes world that will be published by investigators over the course of the next several months. And we'll reference to that, and we'll talk to you about that. We know -- we have a very good idea where this data comes out because we've seen in all our studies patients have better outcomes or healthier. We end up saving the system money.\\nAnd those are the outcomes that we're hoping to drive with Stelo over time. With respect to GLP-1s, again, the list of studies ongoing is very large. And there are studies where CGM is an element. Again, we expect those studies when they're published to demonstrate the same things that we've talked about before that the use of the CGM with the GLP-1 provides a better result, than a study without it.\\nAnd those studies we published over time, we don't control those investigators. But we expect good data over the course of the year.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHey, thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to understand a little bit more, Kevin, if you could give some more clarity on how you think of reimbursement pathway for Stelo could look over the next couple of years? What do you think is needed to open reimbursement up for that product and how you think that would look if it would be done in a more traditional way or do you think it could be done kind of more one-off like the Levels program with UnitedHealthcare?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nOur goal is to do this in a more traditional -- for time. As we've said earlier, we'll launch the product as a cash pay product and have a cash pay option, a cash pay that people can get into and purchase the product. We will accumulate data from those users over time. We'll accumulate data again from the clinical trials that we see out there and ultimately build a case for reimbursement for this product.\\nI think over time, we certainly expect to go to CMS and have people with type 2 diabetes, who are on insulin, covered at some point in time by that group because again, our goal is to spend less money in the healthcare system, and we're one of the few technologies that enables an outcome of that nature. So, we see it being more traditional and working with payers and the various government agencies over time. The programs we will continue to support, we're happy to support them and be partners with them. But I think over time, we need to have a more traditional reimbursement path.\\nAnd that can be -- the partnerships and the relationships can be the only way. On top of that, we'll continue to develop our tools around Stelo. This first generation that we launch is going to be our first pass app. We will have numerous iterations over the course of the first 24 months of that product.\\nIt really makes it a much more inviting and engaging product and lead people to better experiences. So, stay tuned for what we have to say on that front over the next 12 months. It's going to be very exciting.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citigroup. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Nice quarter. A couple of questions, two related ones. Can you sort of give us the guidance for tax and how to think about net interest expense? And then the one that strikes me as somewhat more interesting is I think your LRP is for 21% operating margins.\\nAnd this is the second quarter in a row where you've bypassed that number. So, why is 21% still the right number to be had? Thank you.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Yeah. So, we'll start with tax. I think this year, we kind of dropped down to closer to that 26% range.\\nWhile we don't necessarily guide year by year to tax, the goal is over the course of the next three to five years to get down into the low 20s. So, I would expect it to continue to come down every year as we grow into the tax structure that we've put in place. In terms of net interest income, some of that -- it's one of those -- it's a bit of a difficult one, but just given where interest rate is going to go over time. But it's pretty straightforward that our cash interest cost is pretty low just given our converts.\\nAnd so, you can basically take a look at the cash on the balance sheet, multiply it by about 4%. And that gets you to about where you'd be for the year. Again, we'll have to keep you updated as interest rates change over time. But that's the other way to think about it.\\nAnd then from an operating margin perspective, we gave the 2025 LRP. That's a 21%. Your point is valid. If you take a look at our guide this year at 20% and our gross margin of 63% to 64%, if we hold true to our 65% gross margin in 2025, which is absolutely our belief, you're already there at 21% of margin.\\nSo, I absolutely understand the mathematics. It just means we're ahead. We're ahead of our LRP, but we're not necessarily willing to update it at this point. We'll come forward and we'll update it at some point in the future.\\nBut I think it's a good thing. We've done a lot of work around this, Joanne, around getting lean and making sure we drive leverage into the business. And the great news is as we are ahead. And so, that's a good spot to be in, and we'll continue to do so.\\nOne other maybe caveat just I think it's important to note on the year. I think you asked the question a little bit about the year and why are we on the year. We're making some good investments this year in the organization. We're launching Stelo, and we talked about that being a significant investment in the business.\\nWe're certainly doing a lot of work around our sales force. And if you recall, a few years ago, we did some work around that, and we took a step back on margin. We're going to do all that and still step forward. We're going to go direct in Japan this year.\\nThat's another thing that we're making an investment in. And then all the work Kevin referenced around the clinical work that we're doing around continuing to improve our product. We're going to make all those investments and still deliver an expansion of operating margins. So, I think it just goes to show you, we're building the levers in here.\\nBut I think you can see that we're building and that you can rely on us longer term to continue to drive that through the business.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\\nMatthew O'Brien -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the domestic performance, there's been a clear acceleration in the back half of '23 on a two-year stacked basis. And I'm wondering specifically if that's just basal that's helping there.\\nIt looks like it's as much as 200, maybe 250 basis points of the acceleration. Is that the primary contributor to the domestic acceleration? What should we think about in terms of basal contribution to the topline this year? And are we inflecting right now as far as basal adoption goes with CGM here in the States? Thanks.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. It's a good question. Let me maybe just give some color as to how we're thinking about the guidance. As you see the performance in the back half of the year, a lot of that has to do with being the most accurate sensor, launching with the G7 form factor, and then, of course, having the basal coverage there.\\nAnd so, when you think about it, and you can see the sharetaking when you look at script data, we are taking share. And having the sensor -- the most advanced sensor on the market is the driver there. So, that's taking share. Now, within those spaces, basal is a contributor, no question.\\nAs that category expands and we take share within that category, that does contribute to the overall numbers. And so, you are right, basal is a contributor, but it has as much to do with us taking share as it does with category expansion. So, think about both of those as contributors. As you think about 2024, we've talked a little bit about the adoption rate, basal in total, adopting in this back half of the year around 9% to 10% per year on a per annum basis.\\nThe guide assumes about 8% there. And so, I think you can assume that was the case. Our long-range plan was more like 6% to 7% per year. So, we are seeing basal going faster than what was in our long-range plan.\\nAnd what's great about that is as we continue to take share and the category grows a little faster than expected, that will help contribute over the longer haul. So, hopefully, that gives you some context to how we're seeing basal. It absolutely is a contributor. I don't want to overstate the fact though that basal because, quite frankly, our intensive insulin businesses continue to do really, really well, and you see us taking share there as well.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nI'd just add to Jereme's comments, Matt. If you look at the second half of the year, that's when G7 rolled out. There is a direct correlation to G7 launching and the acceleration of our growth. It really was an important event.\\nAnd the other thing that just as a consequence of what you saw, again, this supports what we're doing in the U.S. with respect to our field sales expansion. We do need to spend more time with physicians who aren't as familiar with our technology as they would have been in the past. And as I said on the call earlier, where we call on somebody, we win.\\nWe do very well. So, we need more calls. We needed more feet on the street and more voice, given the acceleration that we saw and the good things that we saw happen over the second half of the year. So, it all flows together nicely.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Margaret Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.\\nMargaret Andrew -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe spin back to non-insulin. When we kind of run our market models, non-insulin adoption seems to have meaningfully increased, probably for you as well as certainly for the market the last couple of years.\\nAnd again, our numbers probably aren't perfect, but maybe the market's not at 1 million users in the U.S. Could get there this year, and that's a pretty sizable amount. So, I guess, one, are these meaningful patient adds to DexCom already in 2023? And what drove that? And going back to the Stelo guidance of $40 million per year, we can obviously throw some assumptions around ASPs or patient adds, but regardless of what those inputs can be, it pretty quickly gets you to $200 million plus sales in 2025, which is a pretty meaningful chunk of the chain. So, I guess, is that correct? Why could it be right or wrong? And how much of that could be incremental to the initial LRP that you provided in '23? Thanks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nJereme can probably get into more detail than me. It is a part of our business today, Margaret. We do have some non-insulin users for our product. We have some plans that actually cover non-insulin users for CGM.\\nAnd we've seen -- had wonderful experiences there. We also have not an aggressive cash pay program, but a cash pay program nonetheless, where non-insulin users have access to our product through some very traditional distribution channels outside the pharmacy and outside traditional DME. So, some of those individuals have purchased CGM and use it on the non-insulin front as well, and we continue to support programs. But it is not a remarkable chunk of our business.\\nIt has not been a tremendous driver of our growth. It has grown, but it hasn't been a significant percentage. As we look going forward, certainly, again, we gave guidance of 1% for 2024, and we're committed to that. And that certainly is our forecast and what we've guided.\\nWe're most committed to learning because what we're really interested in is a number like $200 million, like you're talking about for 2025 and to be positioned with the right product there. With respect to pricing and how to launch that product, we're going to have tremendous flexibility as this is a cash pay program. And it's not labeled for the current population where we have reimbursement, and where we're reimbursed for our products. So, we believe we'll have, again, flexibility to grow that.\\nAnd growing profitably. So, again, we have a 15-day product going into that market. So, we will have lower COGS. And we're developing a lot of things around that as it rolls out.\\nAs you see, we really are changing the business model to serve this type of individual versus those we've served up to this point in time. We're going to offer a different experience and we'll definitely meet their needs across the board. So, we're bullish on it over time, and it could be a very big number in 2025. That's what we're planning on.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\\nJayson Bedford -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Just on gross margin, I think we came in the last year thinking gross margin would be lower in the second half. It wasn't. I'm guessing revenue levels play a part there.\\nBut outside of price and mix, what weighs on gross margin in '24? And then just as a related question, you had some encouraging comments on Malaysia, and I think you alluded to it, but at what point do we see Malaysia and G7 starting to have a positive impact on gross margin?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHey, Jayson. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Last year, when we made the assumption on what the margin looked like, the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition.\\nWe had a range of assumptions. But the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition would take place perhaps a little bit earlier. And some of that had to do with timing of when the AID systems were available in the market and coverage, and how that goes over time. And so, it took a little bit longer.\\nAnd as a result, we outperformed on margin and it gets back to G6 cost less to make the G7 today. And still, a majority of our users, our legacy base, still sit on the G6 system. With the launch of Tandem and Control-IQ integrated with G7 and obviously, the limited launch with Omnipod 5 coming out here in the back half of Q1, and then obviously, a launch sometime later in the year, we do believe that base starts to move over quicker. And so, what you have there is as that takes place, Jason, you have that shift from a lower cost to a higher-cost product weighing in the start of the year.\\nAnd hence, that's why the margin goes where it goes. Now, in the back half of the year, assuming that base transitions and our models show that over the course of the year, that should. The equilibrium should balance then tilt in the favor of G7. It puts us in a position exiting the year where G7 should be, and we'll have to give you updates on the base as the year progresses, but it should be lower than G6, within at that point, it should be accretive.\\nAnd that would be the exit rate leading now to '24 and then, of course, then bodes well as we move into 2025 and beyond. So, that's the big driver. It's just when does that base transition. And when it does, when do we have that cost kind of equilibrium? So, again, we thought it was going to happen in the back half of 2023.\\nIt didn't take place. We outperformed there in 2023 as a result. Probably going to take place here in the first half of 2024.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Will Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\\nWill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just kind of a follow-up.\\nJust trying to get a color, granularity if possible as you look at the growth in the business and kind of Matt O'Brien's question, but the contribution from basal, hypo, intensive, and type 1, just is it kind of shifting to that order these days where it's more of the basal and hypo and the intensive type 2, is really the new patient growth? And then if so, how should we think about that cadence as you continue to move forward? Thanks.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. I mean, if you think about 2024 at least, 2024, the main contributor to new patients or at least revenue from new patients is still going to sit in the intensive insulin, so the type 1 and type 2 insulin-intensive patients. And that still is where the combination of those two makes up a majority of the new revenue over the course of the year. Basal is catching up, and basal is doing a nice job of catching up, but those in still part of our core business is still actually driving the underlying business.\\nNow, over time, we do expect basal, given it's a larger population to do very, very well. We'll have to give you more of an update as we get into 2025 and beyond as we get closer to that. So, incredibly bullish on the long-term opportunity there with basal. But think about at least 2024, our core business is actually still driving a lot of the growth with obviously longer-term opportunities in basal and then to your point, hypo, which is, quite frankly, still a low contributor, and then with Stelo kind of coming online as well.\\nAll of those are real opportunities in 2025 and beyond.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\\nMichael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask a follow-up on Kevin, your response to the prior question on 15-day and timing. I heard we won't provide a lot of color until we've filed and see a path to approval.\\nThere kind of had been -- it seems like there was a thought that Stelo was kind of the appetizer this year for 15-day and maybe a broader rollout in 2025. And I don't want to -- I'm not asking you to pin down timing but is 2025 a year where a broader transition to 15-day could be affected? Or might all this testing and innovation take a little longer?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe would like to go as fast as possible. If it were on my time frame, it would be yesterday. Stelo at 15 days is a primer for that, so we can learn and gather data from those users as they use it, particularly with our current sensor configuration. As we go through the technology changes that we're making, as we dial in on those features that we're going to put in the final product, we'll get a pivotal trial started and we'll go, but we're learning each and every day.\\nWe are not in a position like we were with G7, where we're submitting an entire new system with completely new hardware and new features and new manufacturing lines, new suppliers, new everything. This 15-day product, we built on the same platform our current G7 is built. So, the time from finishing and pivotal to filing is not going to be near as intent and difficult as it was, with the last product, things such as security and Bluetooth and stuff. We worked through all those issues already.\\nSo, right now, it's really refining the science and getting to 15 days and getting that reliability and quality level that our patients expect from us. We don't view this as an extremely -- I think '25 is a reasonable assumption, but I'm not going to give you an end date as to when because there's too many variables. But we're certainly headed down a path along that type of speed and then we'll see where we land and give you more updates along the way. I just -- filing things or starting things.\\nWhat's important to us is getting things done. And those should be your milestones as well. So, we'll keep you posted, but that's where we are.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is open.\\nChris Pasquale -- Nephron Research -- Analyst\\nThanks. Congrats on the quarter. Wanted to ask a couple of questions about Dexcom ONE and the progress there. I think you had said you expected it to account for about 30% of international new patient starts in '23.\\nCurious if that's where you ended up and what portion of new patient starts you expect it to be in '24.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Yes, we did -- we thought it was going to be about a third of patient starts in 2023 outside the U.S. It was closer to about a quarter of new patient starts.\\nSo, a little bit behind there. Some of the tenders took a little bit more time to get on and -- so it was still a really good year for us, but a little bit behind where we had started the year, at least on the expectations. This year, we expect it to be more and a bigger contributor as a percentage. So, if you think about last year, that was certainly the case.\\nThat was on the G6 form factor. Very excited about, obviously, coming out here on the G7 form factor here in 2024 and the four countries that we already launched in. So, our expectation is a bit bigger percentage, while we haven't necessarily given that number, expect it to be bigger and the team wants it to be bigger as a percentage of new patients outside the U.S. in 2024.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask a follow-up on the type 2 hypo non-insulin -- hypo indication that has coverage.\\nWe didn't think it would move as fast as type 2 basal. But I think you guys talked about a bigger patient opportunity in the U.S. than the type 2 basal patient opportunity. Anything that's been a bottleneck in terms of penetrating that indication? And just how do you see a deeper penetration going forward, into '24, '25, '26? Thanks a lot.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Thanks, Josh. It's an area that -- in all candor, it's gone. And we knew this is going to be a bit of a challenge.\\nIt's a big opportunity, but it's going to take a little bit more time on awareness and getting in front of the physicians and letting folks know that, hey, look, if you've had a hypo event, you do qualify. And by the way, here's how to document it. So, it has been certainly slower than basal. It's not been a real all that material contributor in 2023.\\nWhat we do know, however, is Teri, our chief commercial officer, and her team are very, very focused in getting the word out. And making sure that folks understand if they are suffering with hypo events, this technology can help, and it can help change that and that they do qualify and there is reimbursement out there. And so, it's working on that messaging and making sure that we get out there and understand where those events are taking place. That is, believe it or not, it is a challenge in understanding how to identify when those have took place so that we can get out in front of those folks, but we are working on it.\\nWe have good data around that. And then making sure we're making those physicians that are then serving those patients aware of what the requirements are for documentation so that they can qualify for reimbursement. So, there's some work to be done, but there's a team working very, very intently on it. And making sure that we do arm our sales force and then arm the community with the information needed to help it grow faster.\\nI think it's a big opportunity for us, but I think it's an opportunity that's going to take a little bit longer to penetrate. So, to your point, I think it's a driver -- it's a driver a little bit here in 2024, certainly an opportunity in 2024, but I think it's going to continue to slow roll. But over the longer haul, we do think this is a contributor over time that can be meaningful.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nI'd just add to that. It feeds to the sales force investment we're making in the states. We need to educate physicians and patients. And once you get a population of people who have positive outcomes in this space, and they go back to their doctors and those conversations start taking place, this becomes easier.\\nBut there's a lot of seeding that we have to do to do it, and we needed more feet on the street to do that.\\nOperator\\nAnd we will take our next question from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\\nMike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. One clarifying one on basal. You've previously talked about framing the penetration within basal population relative to the trajectory you saw in insulin-intensive type 2 patients.\\nHow would you characterize that comparison based on where you are today and also as you're looking out over the next few years?\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Yeah. So, in our long-term guide, we had talked about basal, effectively being about six to seven points of adoption as a percentage of the total population here in the U.S. And I'll start with the U.S.\\nbecause internationally, there's a coverage. As we work through coverage there, there's opportunities. But we had talked about that in our 2025 LRP. In our first couple of quarters, we saw it mirror that to your question, to your point, I should say, that it was mirroring the type 2 intensive, which was about a 9% to 10% penetration rate.\\nOur guide, at least for 2024, assumes a middle between those two, 8%. We've got a couple of quarters under our belt. It's very, very positive, but we also want to make sure we're prudent when it comes to guidance. And so, that's why we've assumed about an 8% penetration rate over the course of 2024.\\nObviously, if it mirrors that, which we saw in the back half of 2023, there's opportunities to outperform. And clearly, we're tracking ahead of our LRP, which I think is both positive signals, I think, for the business in total. But again, our guidance has been 8% as a percent of penetration. Hopefully, that helps you.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\\nSteve Lichtman -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\\nThank you. Good evening, guys. Kevin, you mentioned to an earlier question, different business models for Stelo. How should we think what the go-to-market could look like? Does it have a Dexcom ONE more direct-to-patient feel? And do you need to make any significant investments in back-office support as the denominator really expand as you go after this large non-insulin group?\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThat's a great question, and that is a very pertinent topic of discussion and meeting here within the walls of our company. We are very much evaluating very efficient ways to serve such a large patient group and a patient group that may interact differently with us than those who've been on insulin over time as we build those models out. So, we are looking at distribution models that appear different than what we are doing today. So, we can most efficiently get that product to people.\\nAnd again, starting with cash pay, it gives us some opportunities to do things a little different than we've done in the past. And so, you'll have to stay tuned for that. It's a very thoughtful question and very much in line with everything that's going on here every day.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our final question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open.\\nMatt Miksic -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHey, great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So, one follow-up on margins and kind of mix, as you drive G7 to be a bigger part of your business. You mentioned before, and I think we understand the ramping G7 volumes, improving gross margin and profitability of that product line over time.\\nAnd just wondering if you could share maybe how we should think about the long term. Like in other words, G7 is more profitable now. Do you have a G6 more profitable now rather just the maturity of those lines? So G7 exceeds that. Does Stelo trail G7? Does Dexcom ONE with G7 kind of trail that, maybe just some sense directionally of where those are headed over the intermediate and long term would be super helpful as you drive these volumes up.\\nThanks so much.\\nJereme Sylvain -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, maybe what I'll talk about is how we're thinking about the cost of the product. And then I think from there, we can kind of make some calls on how we think about margin from that perspective. And I'll maybe comment a little bit on the service model, which I think is also important because that will help from the operating margin.\\nSo, as you think about the G7, just the product itself, as of today, it costs more than G6. And so, that will eventually, we expect over the course of this year flip. And as you kind of get your models kind of bent out or kind of laid out, we expect to get down to a $10 sensor, irrespective of whether it's 10 or 15 days as we exit the 2025 LRP into early 2026. So, that gives you some kind of feel for where we'll get to the cost of each sensor.\\nNow, each sensor, the hardware is about the same cost, whether it's Stelo, whether it's Dexcom ONE, or whether it's the G-Series. It's the support models, the software, the support, the R&D, the investment in it, and then, of course, the service models that ultimately then change it. And so, as you think about all of the work that we put into the G-Series, the G-Series will have the highest reimbursement, but it will also have the highest service model and then the most investment in software and otherwise. Dexcom ONE is a little bit more of a different service model.\\nAnd thus, we are able to reduce the burden associated with some of the warranty and then the support cost that play into that. And then Stelo is in a 15-day form factor. And so, that's helpful from a gross margin perspective as you think through that over time. So, I think that's the way to think about the cost profile.\\nWe haven't launched the price of Stelo at this point, so we can't necessarily give you the specific margin at this point. Otherwise, maybe pretty obvious how we're thinking about it. But over time, as that comes out, I think it will help align the models. And I think there's real opportunities here as you think about a 15-day -- a 15-day product, starting with Stelo.\\nBut as that then makes its way through Dexcom ONE and the G-Series over time. Again, more levers there where there are some real opportunities in those product lines to continue to drive profitability. So, I think there's levers across all of these. I hope that gives you some context.\\nI realize I'm not giving you a P&L for each one of them, but at least it gives you some context at the hardware costs and we differentiate on the opex cost and service models and then, of course, the days of wearing each one.\\nOperator\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.\\nKevin Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you very much. It's very easy during these earnings calls to talk about percentages and margins and future technologies, financial guidance, competitors, a whole host of important engaging topics. But as we wrap up today, I really want to focus on 2023, which is truly the most remarkable year in our history. Let's review these numbers again, $700 million in organic revenue growth, more than $1 billion in EBITDA, 600,000 new customers in our active user base, standing up a plant in Asia without missing a beat, and, of course, launching our G7 product all over the world.\\nWhile best-in-class technology is foundational and fundamental to these types of accomplishment, it doesn't happen without exceptional people going above and beyond. So, as we close out 2023, I want to thank our -- I guess we're now more than 10,000 DexCom employees around the world. Incredibly well done. Thanks, everybody.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

(NASDAQ:ALPN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 23, 2023\\n\\nOperator: Welcome to the Alpine Immune Sciences Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Temre Johnson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alpine. Ms. Johnson, I'll now turn the call over to you.\\n\\nTemre Johnson: Thank you, Carrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Dr. Mitchell Gold, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Stanford Peng, President and Head of Research and Development; and Paul Rickey, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mitch, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and involve risk and uncertainties as a result and the timing of events, potential publication of clinical data and expectations regarding the sufficiency of cash and investment could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risk and uncertainties. You may refer to the most recent SEC filings regarding risk factors associated with these statements. Mitch, please go ahead.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you, Temre. Alpine is off to a strong start in 2023 driven by progress in the development of povetacicept, a potentially best-in-class dual inhibitor of BAFF and APRIL cytokines with a convenient once every four weeks simultaneous dosing regimen that we believe has the potential manifestations with erythematosus, autoimmune inflammatory diseases. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved a significant milestone for Povetacicept with the initiation of the RUBY-3 basket study, a first patient-based study for the program, it will study Povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis indications including IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and primary membranous nephropathy. Although still early in development, investigator enthusiasm for the program, and interest in participating in the RUBY-3 study is highly encouraged.\\n\\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\\n\\nIn addition to RUBY-3, we are planning to initiate the the RUBY-4 basket study an autoimmune autoimmune cytopenias in the second quarter of 2023. This includes the autoimmune thrombocytopenia, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinin disease. We expect to share initial data from both the RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 basket studies by the end of this year. We see broad development potential for Povetacicept in multiple indications beyond the basket studies, including our RUBY-2 study systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as neurologic, dermatologic and other rheumatic disease indications. We recently signed a collaboration with Truveta to help accelerate the broad development of Povetacicept across these multiple indications. But then increasingly competitive and sometimes challenging clinical trial Truveta gives us access to its 28th partner members, who provide 16% of patient care in the United States.\\n\\nIn addition to our own efforts, we will leverage Truveta's platform and analytics capabilities to more quickly identify and recruit study participants for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 with the potential to benefit most Povetacicept. We will evoke Povetacicept has the potential to be a pipeline and project with a strong balance sheet and promising preclinical and Phase 1 healthy volunteer data, we are rapidly moving forward with a robust development plan for Povetacicept. And now I will turn over the call over to Stanford to review our progress, provide updates on our broad plans for POVI in more detail. Stanford? Thank you, Mitch. As a reminder, Povetacicept is an Fc fusion of a variant TACI domain, engineered to inhibit more potently the April and BAFF cytokines with wild-type TACI IV fusion proteins.\\n\\nThe clinical relevance of these cytokines continues to grow in multiple autoimmune diseases with proof-of-concept and/or encouraging clinical data is \\u0080\\u0093 in diseases such as systemic lupus, lupus nephritis, IgA, nephropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and Myasthenia gravis. In preclinical studies, Povetacicept has superior to wild-type wild-type TACI IV comparators, as well as inhibitors of only April and BAFF demonstrates potent activity in multiple disease relevant animal health. At Phase 1 human study in adult healthy volunteers, Povetacicept has been well tolerated. It has demonstrated excellent PK and PD, including dose-related reductions in circulating antibody-secreting cells, and serum in globulins as well as the IgA nephropathy relevant biomarker, galactose-deficient IgA1.\\n\\nAgain initial multi dose experiences in each population we are initially focusing on two basket studies. The first is RUBY-3, an open-label basket study in autoimmune glomerulonephritides. This study has just recently begun enrolling. Second, we shortly follow with RUBY-4, an open-label basket study in autoimmune cytopenias. The initial data from these studies we anticipate the ability next year to begin multiple Phase 2 studies including one in systemic lupus erythematosus known as RUBY-2. Additional studies in other disease areas are of great interest, including nephrology or hematology, urology, dermatology, as well as rheumatology besides lupus. Some of these we envision could proceed via an accelerated approval pathway. In summary, Povetacicept can potently target both the April and BAFF cytokines in a unique highly differentiated way.\\n\\nstudy that has broad development potential. We look forward to sharing additional data as the program progresses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul Rickey.\\n\\nPaul Rickey: Thank you, Stanford. I will now provide an overview of our financials for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized under our collaboration programs for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $2.8 million, compared to $4.5 million in 2021. The decrease primarily related to lower revenue recognized under our collaboration with AbbVie, partially offset by revenue recognized in the services performed in connection with our collaboration with Horizon, which was executed late in 2021. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31st 2022, were $18.8 million, compared to $15.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related due to increased head count to support our ongoing and planned clinical development programs.\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter ended December, 31st 2022 we're $4.4 million, compared to $4.5 million for 2021. The company reported net losses of $18.9 million and $15.2 million for the fourth quarter ended 20 22 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31st 2022, Alpine's cash and investments totaled $273.4 million, which we anticipate should be sufficient on our planned operation through 2025. I will now hand the call back to Mitch.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Paul. As Stanford highlighted, we are highly encouraged by the progress of Povetacicept, a milestone that we believe is the only truly potent dual /APRIL/BAFF inhibitor. As a result, we believe in the broad potential for the program may become an important immune disease-modifying therapy, present multiple be some mediated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In closing, we believe we have laid a strong foundation to walk to the next phase of Alpine as we progress throughout the course of this year and into next year. Operator, now open the phone for questions.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And we\\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Mike Ulz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on getting the RUBY-3 study going here. Maybe just a question in terms of both basket studies and maybe you can comment on how you\\u2019re currently thinking about dosing. And if there\\u2019s any additional dosing work you plan to do before getting into the indication specific cohorts in the basket studies. And I guess, part of why I\\u2019m asking I looked on clinicaltrials.gov and I noticed some differences in the dosing that you\\u2019re using for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yes. Maybe I\\u2019ll the first part of that Mike. Thanks for the question and I\\u2019ll ask Stanford to walk you. So just as a reminder, RUBY-3 has two different dose escalations that will be going through both an 80 milligram cohort, and a 240 milligram cohort. And RUBY-4 will be going directly into the 240 milligram dosing group. So there will be no 80 milligram cohort in that group.\\n\\nStanford Peng : That\\u2019s correct. And so, there\\u2019s no, there\\u2019s no pre-indication, sort of phase of the study will be going directly into all three diseases in both trials at the doses that Mitch mentioned.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Got it. That\\u2019s helpful and maybe just one more question from me. I noticed in the press release. For RUBY-2 you plan to sort of start that study in mid 2024 and you make a comment on some \\u2013 based on some enabling data from RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 studies. Maybe you can just clarify what you\\u2019re hoping to learn from those studies that will enable you to start RUBY-2?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Primarily multi-dose data, as you know the phase one study we ran into those pending dose studies. In addition, it will give us greater confidence in to dose selection for the Phase 2 let\\u2019s say.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Good. Got it. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Mike.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Tara Bancroft with Cowen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nTara Bancroft : Hi guys. And thanks for taking the question. So, I\\u2019m wondering what do you expect the rate of enrollment to be in the basket studies now, especially given the Truveta collaboration? And when do you think that you might reach full enrollment? Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Well, we\\u2019ll update it. Enrolling in general has been a challenging in a clinical trial environment to enroll patients. That being said, I\\u2019m pretty pleased with the way RUBY-3 has started. We are getting a lot of investigator interest and a lot of patient interest and I think you saw that in our comments in the press release today. So that in and of itself is encouraging. But I would say it\\u2019s purely on start of that trial but that trial continues we expect it to enroll fairly rapidly. The Truveta collaboration, I\\u2019ll talk a little bit about, Tara I appreciate you bringing that up. You know, I think we welcome to enroll the trials in a very traditional way we work with \\u2013 and we engage investigators in a really active way to identify patients to bring up in the trials.\\n\\nI think one of the things as an industry that we\\u2019ve done fairly poorly is using some of the new electronic medical record systems, and work organization across multiple centers to identify them quickly and then include patients in the clinical trials. Honestly, Truveta is a Seattle-based company. We know them well and work with them to kind of enable their member their member partners io identify patients that are relevant for RUBY-3 and we look forward to enroll them in our clinical trials.\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Thomas Smith with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Brian Conley on for Tom. I believe you just responded to a question about Truveta, but just curious if there are any other gating factors or any other obstacles or challenging factors you\\u2019re encountering as you\\u2019re progressing the basket trials. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah. Thanks Brian. No, I think the reason we put Truveta in place was to be proactive at the start of the study. These are things that you want to be in front of. I would say our traditional efforts are looking at let us exceed the trial and get started in terms of law I think because awareness on the targets and strong awareness in the space. And we have a great group of investigators that we have brought in. The reason we brought Truveta onboard is we want to ask \\u2013 add it on probably one of the number one, do it at the beginning of the trial. And two, as we push into the Phase 2 study next year that\\u2019s clearly resulted in accelerated approval. We wanted the collaboration between us and Truveta to be kind of fully integrated, so we can leverage it as we move into these studies.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Mark Breidenbach with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a quick couple from me. First on the Truveta collaboration. Have you any thoughts on what they\\u2019re getting in return for helping optimize enrollment of RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: I am sorry. I lost you one second. Can you say that one more time?\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Yeah, sorry. What\\u2019s Truveta getting in return for helping you guys enroll in RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Let me take in traditional services agreement. So there\\u2019s kind of a baseline fee that we pay them and then as they enroll a certain number of patients, they have certain objectives that they need to meet to be able to generate service fees and as a result of that. So, it\\u2019s not any direct measures on services security.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. And with regard to the upcoming presentation at WCN from RUBY-1, is there anything in that presentation that we haven\\u2019t already seen? What\\u2019s kind of going to be the focus of that upcoming presentation next week?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Our main goal is to \\u2013 reader awareness we didn\\u2019t present there last year that I am sure you\\u2019re aware, but make sure that, just build awareness about the target and the molecule with that audience, as it will be updated Phase 1 data with regard to additional follow-up is some of the subjects. Although the general conclusions about change that you can tell us some of our preceding comments.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. Maybe one last one for me. I know, you mention the 80 mg and 240 mg dosing cohorts in RUBY-3. Can you just comment on the dosing schedules and how those compare to, let\\u2019s say, if we use povetacicept as the closest equivalent or competing drug, how will the dosing schedules compare between your drug and RemeGen\\u2019s? Thank you.\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, our trials both are doing things in a two four week dose regimen and as at all doses, for both doses being tested. As far as we are aware, RemeGen is 160 milligrams of Sub-Q weekly and it appears to be the doses for all their pivotal trials. So, when the person where Q4 versus Q1 week. As you know, we start to talk about best-in-class potential for POVI where the key things that differentiate us is, one that we were potent, two that we have a much more convenient dosing schedule and the fact that we cover both cytokines more completely than either of the wild-type TACI \\u0080\\u0093 in three broad development plan going forward.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our last question from the line of with Joe Pantginis with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks taking the question. Wanted to get a little more color if you can regarding the end-of-year initial data from both RUBY- 3 and RUBY-4. Is this going to be essentially, early response type of data for each type of indication or can we get more than that initially with regard to say any translational or PD data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, we\\u2019ll be focusing quite a bit on both traditional endpoints, as well as biomarker-related data. So, PD endpoints, including immunoglobulintarget, cytokine targets, as well as biomarkers or things like a Gd-IgA1 in IG nephropathy as each of these indications has their respective antibody that we will be looking at. So we\\u2019ll be looking all of that and look forward to be able to report that early this year.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : That\\u2019s great. And do you think you could just remind, I mean, since it\\u2019s a basket concept, how many per indication you\\u2019re looking for and how many you think that might deliver for the initial data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: It\\u2019s a basket trial. We\\u2019ll see harmonization that I can say that we\\u2019re getting interest. The recent RUBY-3 so far we are getting interest in across all the different subtypes, lupus nephritis and primary membranous nephropathy. Exactly how that mix is going to shake out surely to say right now, but early on we\\u2019re pretty pleased with the mix of interest that\\u2019s coming into the trial.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Sure, got it. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: There are no for the questions, Dr. Gold. I\\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you operator. Thank you all for taking part in today\\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you in upcoming investor and medical meetings and providing updates in the months ahead. Thank you and have a great afternoon.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our call today. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Operator\\nWelcome to the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, vice president of investor relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.\\nIn addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\\nSteve Frank -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our chief executive officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S.\\nGAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13th, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin. \\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S.\\nand 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises.\\nWe don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the No. 1 selling OA pain product in Europe.\\nAt Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth.\\nSimilarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain maps. Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism.\\nWe remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.\\nAs we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance.\\nOur dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market.\\nOur focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition.\\nI want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders.\\nWhile there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you. Now let me hand it over to Wetteny.\\nWetteny?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S.\\nand international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animals was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction among both vets and pet owners.\\nOur key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals.\\nAdjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while international segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%.\\nWe saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.\\nSimparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S.\\nand international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from Draxxin and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims.\\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal pre price buy-in at the end of last year.\\nIn the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.\\nMoving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S.\\nsales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S.\\nsales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S.\\nWe have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%.\\nGrowth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges and in advance of a than expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and a significant advantage of being first to market. Key dermatology products sales in the U.S.\\nwere $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. Simparica franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our U.S.\\ncompanion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.\\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\\nGrowth in our OA pain products was equally driven by full focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis.\\nWe continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness.\\nThis growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio.\\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition-related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation.\\nR&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.\\nAdjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders.\\nFor the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024.\\nPlease note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points.\\nwith significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume.\\nWe expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally.\\nOur current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio.\\nFor livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth.\\nFor companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio.\\nWe expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination animal parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.\\nAdjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix.\\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million.\\nThis is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market.\\nand growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.\\nTo summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future.\\nAs we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. So can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the U.S. and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter to quarter.\\nAnd then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp-up of Librela that weigh on margins. But can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher-margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer-term margin leverage. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yeah. We were very pleased with how we did with Librela in this first full quarter of launch in Q4.\\nAs you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we -- given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected in line with our expectations. So that makes us really confident as we go into the year.\\nwe're looking at what -- your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clicks. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the No.\\n1 selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the U.S. as well. So we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the U.S.\\nSo I'll let Wetteny take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed, there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond, we do have Librela in 2023, as we've said at Investor Day, if you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand. They started being dilutive to the overall company average, for example, in 2023. As we go through 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below whether you would consider our innovative companion animal products.\\nAnd as we exit '24 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So overall, beyond '24, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect. But I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So that mix will continue to be favorable for us.\\nAnd as we get into the higher levels of production from monoclonal antibodies, they are also accretive to overall margins. And we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023.\\nAnd as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we're positioned to continue to expand.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So it looks like you're guiding back in the analogue math you're guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024.\\nBut you also did finish '23 lower than we would have expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You call out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation.\\nAny way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in '23? And then maybe what some of those onetime headwinds would have as an impact to 2024. Just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela. I don't believe you actually quantified the target.\\nSo I want to -- just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point. is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable. And especially that's for U.S., but then on the OUS side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of the Europe and it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So any color on what's going on internationally? Thanks.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure, Mike. Let me take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So take a look at margins. Indeed, in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion in margins.\\nKeep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact and about 80 of that is from FX. So you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly, a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our lifestyle team in Utah, and look, they've had a great year, and we expect lifestyle continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end.\\nSo that created a little bit of a mix. Yes, and as well as Librela outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit dilutive. So when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting '23. Most of the impact here is coming from FX about 80 basis points.\\nThe other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended FX is that has the impact on our on our finish here. If you take a look at FX, which is clearly nonoperational and you factor nonrecurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition. Those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here.\\nOf course, we don't forecast FX. So what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are. at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024.\\nAnd so that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past, and I will sit here and guess what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024, and that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes. For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue. Price is a pretty significant factor.\\nWe continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of 2 to 3 points. And perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And the Librela with the U.S. launch, clearly is going to be a significant factor.\\nCertainly, $44 million in the quarter and Q4 was, again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So you can model that out in terms of what that would translate to. We're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far as we discussed already.\\nIn international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets in addition to the U.S.\\n$44 million. So I think what we have to really take into account here is as we've been launching in markets. In Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out, you just focus on those markets that we've already launched.\\nWe're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters about give or take. So we're going to be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat.\\nOperator\\nWe'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\\nJon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nOK. Thanks guys. Good morning. Wendy, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of the easier 1Q '23 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half.\\nSo just -- how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And in the guidance for the full year, maybe GM, we're a little bit below what we were thinking. But SG&A expense despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So maybe you can just talk through those items why we're only seeing seems like low to mid-single-digit SG&A growth year over year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX? And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the U.S.\\n4Q '23 to 1Q '24 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks guys.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, John. If you look in Q1, certainly if you look at companion animal in the U.S., this is an easier comp.\\nWe had destocking in the first quarter last year. clearly something we look to see as an easier comp we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so I think if you look to balance complete the balance, but it's lifestyle growth both in the U.S.\\nas well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So that becomes a heavier I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions -- weather conditions in Australia, etc., are having an impact there. So I think if you balance those out and last point I'll make is, Librela, we are clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year.\\nSo Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Novella accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relative to speaking in Q1. So when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now we did make references to FX.\\nSo from a reported basis, that, again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple of weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. When FX de facto, hopefully, what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with the momentum as we exited Q4 and Q1, again, looking at U.S.\\ncompanion animal, but that's how I think about it. Now is Q1 is going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective, I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stock in that $12 million to $15 million. So even if you had a flat that means you grow by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here.\\nRight now, what I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDave Westenberg -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. So last year, we saw some discounting in front of the next gaurd combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of Elanco's Quattro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just a second one on just the DTC efforts on Librela.\\nI don't think there is DC allowed in Europe. But can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and maybe how that messaging can come out? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year, overall Trio grew 9%.\\nSo we're very pleased with that as we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in Trio for the year. So this obviously underscores everything and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So we do anticipate, obviously, a competitor entering I'm not exactly sure what -- how Elanco's Quattro will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product.\\nThey do mention taper, but you get tapeworm from fleas then we actually control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So we abused to having good competitors, obviously, with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional.\\nBut I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone entree is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market.\\nWhat we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, etc. So as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on what have we learned from Librela in Europe, so we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness.\\nI think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to encouraging them that there is a new product and then they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplift from direct-to-consumer advertising even when it's not branded. So I don't know what you want to add into that?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio been performing really well for us in the face of drug competition in the U.S. going to be more pleased. And to be gaining patient share in the face of competition.\\nI think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So look, there'll be some initial heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in with factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't hold in on specific reaction and so on, but we're very confident in our ability to grow continued growth franchise, and we're saying we're going to see mid- to single-digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid- to high single-digit growth for the franchise overall.\\nI guess, specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China. Could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that, that growth is obviously understated given the price -- if you're looking at the pre priced buy-in that we saw in late 2022.\\nAs we look at our guidance for mid- to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the U.S. You have pruritus.\\nThere is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market, seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products.\\nOur products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vest. And we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, build a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet and our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in Apoquel chewable and moving them to chewable pet owners really prefer.\\nWe've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the U.S. And we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term on the long-acting. So we are going to defend this franchise.\\nWe're confident in this franchise, our guidance of mid- to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the U.S. and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring life cycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. And one point on derm of course, we have a mid- to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance. of course, across a broad range of expectation there, there's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, etc., will play into that and the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow.\\nOur franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting to ignore nor improve at least through the first half of our year, and we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, little bit less so into the first half of '24, but still a headwind into the first half of '24.\\nYou continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices are remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So all those factors, of course, long term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade. But in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth.\\nIn fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBalaji Prasad -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. A couple. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points return revenue and 150 basis points on EPS is to be going from here.\\nWhy is FX severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean my general understanding is with $4 billion of -- $4-plus billion of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis received on Librela number. I wanted to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela's as promotion with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points, and what is the current status now with regard to your communication with FDA.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure Balaji, so I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I see you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification, would -- what you're talking about is a request for clarification on our promotional materials.\\nWe just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean this isn't uncommon. So I don't -- that was easily resolved last year, that was a minor issue.\\nBut Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. On currency dynamics. And again, we don't forecast FX. So we tend to report out what we see the impact is.\\nAnd the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina, if you follow Argentina, there have been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August. And there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those clearly is impact on top line that we've talked about. But there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time.\\nSo by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down to bottom line. So combinations volume. Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced in their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they value. That's what you're seeing play out.\\nBut really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\\nBrandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre priced buying in the quarter. Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that, maybe higher level.\\nIs there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us, you're still spending a lot of money in R&D and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre priced buying in our -- as we exit the year given where what our price increases are going to be I would say, compared to the prior year where there was higher than average reprice buying as in 2022 into 2023, which had the impact on '24, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of reprice buying exiting 2023. And that gave us really First, the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into but also, I would say, our quarter position walking into January 2024, we're certainly in a better position than, say, the prior year.\\nSo we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. And the question with regards to R&D. Obviously, we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health.\\nAnd if you look at the -- how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium and long term. In Animal Health, different than human health, that really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like life cycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apical Chewable, which will significantly support our key brands.\\nWe're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one- to three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long-acting. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term and really important new franchises as well, such as renal, chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes, there's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics as well as behind our livestock business.\\nlooking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nChris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth.\\nI know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. I'm just trying to get more color on what is the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still that capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex U.S.\\nFrom your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm showing a sense of like we're in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex U.S. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered as we've spoken about many times before to that business. I mean obviously, they're not inconsequential our view of 0% to 1% is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time.\\nSo I think we're really saying it's back to normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the U.S. But I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it.\\nBut we really sort of view the year as you look into the year for although we saw flat vet visits, we spot revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously, overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time. with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, etc. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the U.S., I think we're still early innings.\\nAnd really where I think we see the growth is right now, that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs. I mean, I think, obviously, at least somewhere -- I mean in my 50s, I will say, my hip hurts right now. But everyone doesn't know that it's around me.\\nAnd so the reality is osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're living and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think, is critical. So I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first-line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think we more -- we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise.\\nSo we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Stephen Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nUnknown speaker\\nThis is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First, on Librela. To what degree are U.S.\\ndebt capacity constraints, the headwind to longer-term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home administrative formulation? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So that capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on. But I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech.\\nAnd I think the industry is really focused, and we've been partnering with corporates the ABM with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far, globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a U.S. issue, it's global.\\nSo far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second question is with regard to home delivery. You want to take that one?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock and innovation, not only in our OA pain maps, but across our portfolio, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer-acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela will be the direction that will help with this, even though as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the maps.\\nI think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, etc. And that varies a bit, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\nNavann Ty -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions I have two ones on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela.\\nWith continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&As in addition to the current testing campaign -- and just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025. And then on Trio, can you help us explain the switches from to Mexico plus? Are they mostly from BI's homes like large rather than from Simparica Trio and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments, and we already started because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing the DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about year and a half or so ago. So we're able to leverage those investments, and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product.\\nThe gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023 and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage above. So 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it's below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see at those innovative levels, which is above -- well above the company. average.\\nSo hopefully, that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth, grew 17% in the U.S. in and we continue to gain patient share, which means, again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe effication has been in the market. for almost four years now.\\nSo we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know if Kristin, you want to add.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nWe're doing quite well of topics U.S. specifically with regards to puppies. I mean puppies are on the Trio label. So I just want to emphasize that.\\nI know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So I mean, really, if you're looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual agent customers to a triple combination and certainly a movement to more people from topical to oral. So there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies to answer that other part of your question.\\nOperator\\nThere seem to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nGreat. Thank you all so much for the questions. And honestly, your continued interest in Zoetis. I want to undergo that the enduring strength of the human animal bond for pet owners expectations of human-quality healthcare for pets and the need for safe and secure food supply all underscore that animal health industry is essential and very durable.\\nWe remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just a line and to grow operational revenue by mid- to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio, and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises. The animal health industry is resilient even in times of uncertainty, and we are poised to navigate these challenges because our portfolio diversity, our commitment to exceptional customer experience, operational excellence, and agility, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in future calls.\\nThanks a must for joining us today, guys. Have a great day.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\n\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nGood morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.\\nWith the exception of any participant's questions asked, during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, vice president, investor relations.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, chairman and chief executive officer; Bob Funck, executive vice president for finance; and Phil Boudreau, senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results, as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time to position the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier, given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing experienced a slowdown to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world placed a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffered during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient.\\nIt was also during this time that we created a multibillion dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders. But we knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead.\\nWe pulled forward our accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale-down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company. Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions.\\nAnd this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution.\\nAnd in medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals, along with several new opportunities, to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year.\\nSales, excluding COVID testing, grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11%, higher than our original guidance of high single-digit growth. Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic. Turning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecasted sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business. I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S.\\nwas driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader. International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\\nTurning to established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results. Moving to diagnostics, growth in rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing.\\nThe flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering. Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations.\\nThe system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales, led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis.\\nIn heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. So, in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year.\\nWe outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil?\\nPhil Boudreau -- Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which as expected reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for 2024, today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024.\\nFor the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice end to the year here. So, Robert, you know, pre-COVID Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically. As you mentioned, you're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base.\\nWhat has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions and I'll leave it there for my one question. Thank you.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and, quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business, I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these four business, and their underlying attractiveness still is, you know, is very sustainable. So, strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these four segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in.\\nSo, I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging, you know, geographies and different markets.\\nAnd they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think you know, even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their margin profile by 300 basis points. So, a pretty strong position, strong team. And then, you know, we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which, historically, hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets.\\nIt's probably been more of a developed market place. So, I think that's going to, you know, provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think, did an incredible job here, as we said at the beginning of last year, regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product.\\nBut even adult -- our adult business. Our adult business has increased $1 billion, you know, since pre-pandemic. And it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion growing high single digits.\\nThere's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that, you know, command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also. Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well.\\nWe've talked about, you know, our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio and, quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. And our rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to, you know, put through those instruments so -- and then, medical devices, you know, historically, was in that high single digit growth.\\nI think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-sized business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like [Inaudible] or EP, structural heart, ADC, I mean those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices, our CRM and vascular businesses that were, you know, showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4. With CRM, I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology.\\nOn vascular, it's been a combination of adding and organically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segment. So, I think that's really, you know, in a nutshell, across all these very four attractive segments, we've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you know, you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth. And they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten, you know, more growth opportunities within.\\nSo, I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about, you know, accelerating sales but, you know, not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. You know, our core business grew EPS last year, you know, 40-plus percent.\\nWe're forecasting double-digit earnings-per-share growth, you know, this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So, I'd say, yeah, you know, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics.\\nBut, you know, we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have. On the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range. But it's only January, so I think this is a good starting point.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nSuper helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and I echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. I was hoping to just follow up on your comments, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. You know, Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally.\\nBut was hoping to just -- thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business and that 30 to 50 basis point range, was hoping you just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in '24 and into the outyears? Thanks for taking the question.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre-pandemic level.\\nAnd I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we managed, you know, very well strategically the spending piece of it. You know, we accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then, we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was, you know, was growing pretty significantly here. So, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line.\\nAnd that is, you know, I think about our big five activities this year in the company. You know, and we can do all five of them at the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. You know, we're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, you know, roughly around 75 basis points.\\nAnd, you know, there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So, you know, every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis, they all get reported out.\\nSo, there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs. Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So, you know, whether it's commodity costs, you know, freight and distribution, you know, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now, and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, you know, turning into tailwinds. So, that helps.\\nAnd then, the other part here is just, you know, I'd say portfolio mix. So, as some of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher-margin businesses. And, you know, they provide that, you know, that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So, I think this provides a nice -- you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year.\\nBut I expect, over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic -- you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's for me it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. You know, we could target, you know, 50, 75. You know, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want.\\nBut, you know, that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to do -- to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. So, I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. So, our big opportunity here is gross margin, and, you know, we're all over it.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches.\\nSo, we'd love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the U.S. EP business as we see some PFA launches this year? Thanks for taking the questions.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Well, I think we've showed a pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition. It's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story.\\nU.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP.\\nBut the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than more than offset that. So, it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So, you know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think, is at the core.\\nYou know, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is, you know, the flexible tip combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's, you know, outcomes for the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world. And then, on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers.\\nAnd, yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So, I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth. As we look to, you know, more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S., listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology.\\nI think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake in usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first -- at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment. And then, from there, then kind of moving past that.\\nSo, you know, right now, I think -- I guess that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that, you know, it will follow a similar pattern. And then, the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground, you know, with the technology.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThank you, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, maybe I could ask on Libre. You know, this is the most successful medical device.\\nAt the conference just a few weeks ago, in San Fran, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward and targets. You know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in '24 and beyond. And one question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data, it's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales, or at least prescriptions are flattening out yet the sales keep growing.\\nHow do we think about the discrepancy there? And how big is the Medicare DME business and, you know, the growth we're getting there from basal? Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Strong growth in Q4, under 1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%.\\nAnd I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But, you know, being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\\nYou know, the growth is going to come from, I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, I mean, a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, OK, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us, but -- and I also think it's multiyear.\\nSo, I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely, you know, two plus-years easily. And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you reference IQVIA, Ravi.\\nSeven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. So, it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where, you know, that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution in growth.\\nI think right now, in the U.S, most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private commercial. Medicare represents about a third of the market. So, I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the build the awareness, you know, build the traveling experience with primary care.\\nAnd that's what we're doing, that's what we have been doing quite frankly for some time. So, it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. And like I said, you know, easily two-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have Robbie, is, you know, looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access, which is that of, you know, pump connectivity, I think this represents a great opportunity for us.\\nIf you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You've got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year. And that patient segment has -- you know, we haven't been able to target it. But now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us.\\nYou know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? Recently, there was an independent third-party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head-to-head study that was published a few weeks ago showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's marred. So, I look at that and I say, OK, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the, you know, best solution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment.\\nSo, I look at the basal, I look at the pump. It's probably good drivers for us, you know, in '24, '25. But, you know, we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. To your question on IQVIA, you know, I think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market.\\nSo, you know, the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So, maybe that's what you're seeing.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate the thoughts.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since this story seems to be very much about wine growth, I haven't heard you reference the Fab 5, one of my favorite analogies in a long time.\\nSo, just wanted to -- and maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab 5 and where, you know, how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth, for 2024? Thanks so much.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products. And we didn't think about calling them that because there was going to be a flash in the pan for, you know, one or two years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company, you know, over the next few years.\\nAnd, you know, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth, and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about, you know, about a point of growth, total Abbott, you know, contribution. So, they're definitely stepping up. And I'd say some of them, I would call market-creating opportunities.\\nTricuspid, I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, you know, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, you know, generating referral pathways. You know, we know how to do this. And we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, you know, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to, you know, market expansion development and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion.\\nAnd, you know, these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments, you know, that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVI space, AVEIR in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that, you know, we're coming in and will have different value propositions. I think AVEIR's got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market.\\nAnd the value proposition for AVEIR, I think, is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implant or to the patient. So, I expect a lot from AVEIR in terms of growth. I expect a lot from, you know, Navitor. And, you know, we're going to be expanding, so we'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan.\\nAnd so, we're investing in those areas. And, yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it, and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year, and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company.\\nSo, you know, that being said, I will say, you know, those are great products, and they take a lot of focus. But we still have -- you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users, this year also. You know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution.\\nWe put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars, in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre. We're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So, yeah, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions.\\nBut there's a lot in the chamber here. And I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nThank you. Very thorough. Thank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year, or nice end to last year, too. So, here's a question I have. In nutrition, you've done a great job of, sounds like, returning to normalcy.\\nI'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track, or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single-digit segment growth category. Thanks.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Yeah, I think kudos to the team here. We set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year, to get to market leadership. In our October call, we had already confirmed that.\\nAnd I'd say over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the No. 2. Yeah, I mean, I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, you know, given the strength of the portfolio of the team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share.\\nYou know, I don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio. So, I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have pre-pandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can, you know, be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down.\\nAnd I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position, with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on healthcare and on nutrition. So, I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher-end 6% range going forward. But I think, right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial-year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range and then as we move into next year, you know, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the adult segment and what is that going to do for us.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Robert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M&A.\\nLooking at the balance sheet, phenomenal position. You at least have a minimum of 20 billion of firepower. Abbott hasn't done any large deals in the last few years. So, my question is, how do you see the opportunity for larger-size deals? What is Abbott's appetite for a larger size, more meaningful transaction?\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet, and it provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So, that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top-line gaps that might be there.\\nSo, that allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then, like you said, you've done the math. We've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good.\\nYou know, profitability matters. You know, earnings matter. And, you know, when you get into these larger-size deals, you know, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top-line play. I think they're harder nowadays.\\nYou know, you look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together, you know, spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought, you know, this business would, you know, would impact the company. So, I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital.\\nAnd -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top-line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to fill a top-line gap.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOperator, we'll take one more question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our last question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some of the companies are kind of calling out above-normal growth.\\nSo, curious, Robert, if you look at your med device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated, you know, catch-ups still coming through? Or do you think this is kind of more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious in some of your thoughts on the overall market.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, I don't think that that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio, I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So, I think there was some disruption, we've talked about it, in some parts of -- some procedures that require a little bit more pre-op planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean, I think those -- that, combined with the labor shortages that occurred, you know, 2022, I think that that that probably slowed a few of them down. But I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that.\\nI just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see, you know, procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in, you know, CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, too, so -- we've seen that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis. A lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our core lab business is actually in the hospital. So, we also get to see that, too.\\nAnd, you know, I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So, we try and triangulate this. I just see this as, you know, procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients, I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve.\\nSome are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and, you know, market positions, etc. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nOK. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023 in many ways. It sort of represented this transition year regarding, you know, the coming down of COVID.\\nI think we did a really good job at managing, you know, the scale-up and the scale-down. A lot of healthcare companies actually participated in trying to solve, you know, the COVID problem. And I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now a transition from being driven by COVID testing to, once again, being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company.\\nWe deliver double-digit organic sales growth on every base business on every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline, we talked a bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024.\\nAnd as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January, so we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOK. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m.\\nCentral Time today on Abbott investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\\nOperator\\nThank you.

(NASDAQ:ALPN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 23, 2023\\n\\nOperator: Welcome to the Alpine Immune Sciences Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Temre Johnson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alpine. Ms. Johnson, I'll now turn the call over to you.\\n\\nTemre Johnson: Thank you, Carrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Dr. Mitchell Gold, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Stanford Peng, President and Head of Research and Development; and Paul Rickey, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mitch, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and involve risk and uncertainties as a result and the timing of events, potential publication of clinical data and expectations regarding the sufficiency of cash and investment could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risk and uncertainties. You may refer to the most recent SEC filings regarding risk factors associated with these statements. Mitch, please go ahead.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you, Temre. Alpine is off to a strong start in 2023 driven by progress in the development of povetacicept, a potentially best-in-class dual inhibitor of BAFF and APRIL cytokines with a convenient once every four weeks simultaneous dosing regimen that we believe has the potential manifestations with erythematosus, autoimmune inflammatory diseases. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved a significant milestone for Povetacicept with the initiation of the RUBY-3 basket study, a first patient-based study for the program, it will study Povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis indications including IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and primary membranous nephropathy. Although still early in development, investigator enthusiasm for the program, and interest in participating in the RUBY-3 study is highly encouraged.\\n\\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\\n\\nIn addition to RUBY-3, we are planning to initiate the the RUBY-4 basket study an autoimmune autoimmune cytopenias in the second quarter of 2023. This includes the autoimmune thrombocytopenia, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinin disease. We expect to share initial data from both the RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 basket studies by the end of this year. We see broad development potential for Povetacicept in multiple indications beyond the basket studies, including our RUBY-2 study systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as neurologic, dermatologic and other rheumatic disease indications. We recently signed a collaboration with Truveta to help accelerate the broad development of Povetacicept across these multiple indications. But then increasingly competitive and sometimes challenging clinical trial Truveta gives us access to its 28th partner members, who provide 16% of patient care in the United States.\\n\\nIn addition to our own efforts, we will leverage Truveta's platform and analytics capabilities to more quickly identify and recruit study participants for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 with the potential to benefit most Povetacicept. We will evoke Povetacicept has the potential to be a pipeline and project with a strong balance sheet and promising preclinical and Phase 1 healthy volunteer data, we are rapidly moving forward with a robust development plan for Povetacicept. And now I will turn over the call over to Stanford to review our progress, provide updates on our broad plans for POVI in more detail. Stanford? Thank you, Mitch. As a reminder, Povetacicept is an Fc fusion of a variant TACI domain, engineered to inhibit more potently the April and BAFF cytokines with wild-type TACI IV fusion proteins.\\n\\nThe clinical relevance of these cytokines continues to grow in multiple autoimmune diseases with proof-of-concept and/or encouraging clinical data is \\u0080\\u0093 in diseases such as systemic lupus, lupus nephritis, IgA, nephropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and Myasthenia gravis. In preclinical studies, Povetacicept has superior to wild-type wild-type TACI IV comparators, as well as inhibitors of only April and BAFF demonstrates potent activity in multiple disease relevant animal health. At Phase 1 human study in adult healthy volunteers, Povetacicept has been well tolerated. It has demonstrated excellent PK and PD, including dose-related reductions in circulating antibody-secreting cells, and serum in globulins as well as the IgA nephropathy relevant biomarker, galactose-deficient IgA1.\\n\\nAgain initial multi dose experiences in each population we are initially focusing on two basket studies. The first is RUBY-3, an open-label basket study in autoimmune glomerulonephritides. This study has just recently begun enrolling. Second, we shortly follow with RUBY-4, an open-label basket study in autoimmune cytopenias. The initial data from these studies we anticipate the ability next year to begin multiple Phase 2 studies including one in systemic lupus erythematosus known as RUBY-2. Additional studies in other disease areas are of great interest, including nephrology or hematology, urology, dermatology, as well as rheumatology besides lupus. Some of these we envision could proceed via an accelerated approval pathway. In summary, Povetacicept can potently target both the April and BAFF cytokines in a unique highly differentiated way.\\n\\nstudy that has broad development potential. We look forward to sharing additional data as the program progresses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul Rickey.\\n\\nPaul Rickey: Thank you, Stanford. I will now provide an overview of our financials for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized under our collaboration programs for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $2.8 million, compared to $4.5 million in 2021. The decrease primarily related to lower revenue recognized under our collaboration with AbbVie, partially offset by revenue recognized in the services performed in connection with our collaboration with Horizon, which was executed late in 2021. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31st 2022, were $18.8 million, compared to $15.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related due to increased head count to support our ongoing and planned clinical development programs.\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter ended December, 31st 2022 we're $4.4 million, compared to $4.5 million for 2021. The company reported net losses of $18.9 million and $15.2 million for the fourth quarter ended 20 22 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31st 2022, Alpine's cash and investments totaled $273.4 million, which we anticipate should be sufficient on our planned operation through 2025. I will now hand the call back to Mitch.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Paul. As Stanford highlighted, we are highly encouraged by the progress of Povetacicept, a milestone that we believe is the only truly potent dual /APRIL/BAFF inhibitor. As a result, we believe in the broad potential for the program may become an important immune disease-modifying therapy, present multiple be some mediated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In closing, we believe we have laid a strong foundation to walk to the next phase of Alpine as we progress throughout the course of this year and into next year. Operator, now open the phone for questions.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And we\\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Mike Ulz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on getting the RUBY-3 study going here. Maybe just a question in terms of both basket studies and maybe you can comment on how you\\u2019re currently thinking about dosing. And if there\\u2019s any additional dosing work you plan to do before getting into the indication specific cohorts in the basket studies. And I guess, part of why I\\u2019m asking I looked on clinicaltrials.gov and I noticed some differences in the dosing that you\\u2019re using for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yes. Maybe I\\u2019ll the first part of that Mike. Thanks for the question and I\\u2019ll ask Stanford to walk you. So just as a reminder, RUBY-3 has two different dose escalations that will be going through both an 80 milligram cohort, and a 240 milligram cohort. And RUBY-4 will be going directly into the 240 milligram dosing group. So there will be no 80 milligram cohort in that group.\\n\\nStanford Peng : That\\u2019s correct. And so, there\\u2019s no, there\\u2019s no pre-indication, sort of phase of the study will be going directly into all three diseases in both trials at the doses that Mitch mentioned.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Got it. That\\u2019s helpful and maybe just one more question from me. I noticed in the press release. For RUBY-2 you plan to sort of start that study in mid 2024 and you make a comment on some \\u2013 based on some enabling data from RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 studies. Maybe you can just clarify what you\\u2019re hoping to learn from those studies that will enable you to start RUBY-2?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Primarily multi-dose data, as you know the phase one study we ran into those pending dose studies. In addition, it will give us greater confidence in to dose selection for the Phase 2 let\\u2019s say.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Good. Got it. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Mike.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Tara Bancroft with Cowen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nTara Bancroft : Hi guys. And thanks for taking the question. So, I\\u2019m wondering what do you expect the rate of enrollment to be in the basket studies now, especially given the Truveta collaboration? And when do you think that you might reach full enrollment? Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Well, we\\u2019ll update it. Enrolling in general has been a challenging in a clinical trial environment to enroll patients. That being said, I\\u2019m pretty pleased with the way RUBY-3 has started. We are getting a lot of investigator interest and a lot of patient interest and I think you saw that in our comments in the press release today. So that in and of itself is encouraging. But I would say it\\u2019s purely on start of that trial but that trial continues we expect it to enroll fairly rapidly. The Truveta collaboration, I\\u2019ll talk a little bit about, Tara I appreciate you bringing that up. You know, I think we welcome to enroll the trials in a very traditional way we work with \\u2013 and we engage investigators in a really active way to identify patients to bring up in the trials.\\n\\nI think one of the things as an industry that we\\u2019ve done fairly poorly is using some of the new electronic medical record systems, and work organization across multiple centers to identify them quickly and then include patients in the clinical trials. Honestly, Truveta is a Seattle-based company. We know them well and work with them to kind of enable their member their member partners io identify patients that are relevant for RUBY-3 and we look forward to enroll them in our clinical trials.\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Thomas Smith with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Brian Conley on for Tom. I believe you just responded to a question about Truveta, but just curious if there are any other gating factors or any other obstacles or challenging factors you\\u2019re encountering as you\\u2019re progressing the basket trials. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah. Thanks Brian. No, I think the reason we put Truveta in place was to be proactive at the start of the study. These are things that you want to be in front of. I would say our traditional efforts are looking at let us exceed the trial and get started in terms of law I think because awareness on the targets and strong awareness in the space. And we have a great group of investigators that we have brought in. The reason we brought Truveta onboard is we want to ask \\u2013 add it on probably one of the number one, do it at the beginning of the trial. And two, as we push into the Phase 2 study next year that\\u2019s clearly resulted in accelerated approval. We wanted the collaboration between us and Truveta to be kind of fully integrated, so we can leverage it as we move into these studies.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Mark Breidenbach with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a quick couple from me. First on the Truveta collaboration. Have you any thoughts on what they\\u2019re getting in return for helping optimize enrollment of RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: I am sorry. I lost you one second. Can you say that one more time?\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Yeah, sorry. What\\u2019s Truveta getting in return for helping you guys enroll in RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Let me take in traditional services agreement. So there\\u2019s kind of a baseline fee that we pay them and then as they enroll a certain number of patients, they have certain objectives that they need to meet to be able to generate service fees and as a result of that. So, it\\u2019s not any direct measures on services security.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. And with regard to the upcoming presentation at WCN from RUBY-1, is there anything in that presentation that we haven\\u2019t already seen? What\\u2019s kind of going to be the focus of that upcoming presentation next week?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Our main goal is to \\u2013 reader awareness we didn\\u2019t present there last year that I am sure you\\u2019re aware, but make sure that, just build awareness about the target and the molecule with that audience, as it will be updated Phase 1 data with regard to additional follow-up is some of the subjects. Although the general conclusions about change that you can tell us some of our preceding comments.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. Maybe one last one for me. I know, you mention the 80 mg and 240 mg dosing cohorts in RUBY-3. Can you just comment on the dosing schedules and how those compare to, let\\u2019s say, if we use povetacicept as the closest equivalent or competing drug, how will the dosing schedules compare between your drug and RemeGen\\u2019s? Thank you.\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, our trials both are doing things in a two four week dose regimen and as at all doses, for both doses being tested. As far as we are aware, RemeGen is 160 milligrams of Sub-Q weekly and it appears to be the doses for all their pivotal trials. So, when the person where Q4 versus Q1 week. As you know, we start to talk about best-in-class potential for POVI where the key things that differentiate us is, one that we were potent, two that we have a much more convenient dosing schedule and the fact that we cover both cytokines more completely than either of the wild-type TACI \\u0080\\u0093 in three broad development plan going forward.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our last question from the line of with Joe Pantginis with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks taking the question. Wanted to get a little more color if you can regarding the end-of-year initial data from both RUBY- 3 and RUBY-4. Is this going to be essentially, early response type of data for each type of indication or can we get more than that initially with regard to say any translational or PD data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, we\\u2019ll be focusing quite a bit on both traditional endpoints, as well as biomarker-related data. So, PD endpoints, including immunoglobulintarget, cytokine targets, as well as biomarkers or things like a Gd-IgA1 in IG nephropathy as each of these indications has their respective antibody that we will be looking at. So we\\u2019ll be looking all of that and look forward to be able to report that early this year.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : That\\u2019s great. And do you think you could just remind, I mean, since it\\u2019s a basket concept, how many per indication you\\u2019re looking for and how many you think that might deliver for the initial data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: It\\u2019s a basket trial. We\\u2019ll see harmonization that I can say that we\\u2019re getting interest. The recent RUBY-3 so far we are getting interest in across all the different subtypes, lupus nephritis and primary membranous nephropathy. Exactly how that mix is going to shake out surely to say right now, but early on we\\u2019re pretty pleased with the mix of interest that\\u2019s coming into the trial.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Sure, got it. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: There are no for the questions, Dr. Gold. I\\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you operator. Thank you all for taking part in today\\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you in upcoming investor and medical meetings and providing updates in the months ahead. Thank you and have a great afternoon.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our call today. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Operator\\nWelcome to the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, vice president of investor relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.\\nIn addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\\nSteve Frank -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our chief executive officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S.\\nGAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13th, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin. \\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S.\\nand 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises.\\nWe don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the No. 1 selling OA pain product in Europe.\\nAt Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth.\\nSimilarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain maps. Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism.\\nWe remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.\\nAs we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance.\\nOur dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market.\\nOur focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition.\\nI want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders.\\nWhile there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you. Now let me hand it over to Wetteny.\\nWetteny?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S.\\nand international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animals was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction among both vets and pet owners.\\nOur key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals.\\nAdjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while international segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%.\\nWe saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.\\nSimparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S.\\nand international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from Draxxin and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims.\\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal pre price buy-in at the end of last year.\\nIn the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.\\nMoving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S.\\nsales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S.\\nsales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S.\\nWe have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%.\\nGrowth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges and in advance of a than expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and a significant advantage of being first to market. Key dermatology products sales in the U.S.\\nwere $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. Simparica franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our U.S.\\ncompanion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.\\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\\nGrowth in our OA pain products was equally driven by full focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis.\\nWe continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness.\\nThis growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio.\\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition-related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation.\\nR&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.\\nAdjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders.\\nFor the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024.\\nPlease note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points.\\nwith significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume.\\nWe expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally.\\nOur current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio.\\nFor livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth.\\nFor companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio.\\nWe expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination animal parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.\\nAdjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix.\\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million.\\nThis is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market.\\nand growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.\\nTo summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future.\\nAs we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. So can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the U.S. and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter to quarter.\\nAnd then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp-up of Librela that weigh on margins. But can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher-margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer-term margin leverage. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yeah. We were very pleased with how we did with Librela in this first full quarter of launch in Q4.\\nAs you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we -- given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected in line with our expectations. So that makes us really confident as we go into the year.\\nwe're looking at what -- your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clicks. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the No.\\n1 selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the U.S. as well. So we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the U.S.\\nSo I'll let Wetteny take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed, there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond, we do have Librela in 2023, as we've said at Investor Day, if you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand. They started being dilutive to the overall company average, for example, in 2023. As we go through 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below whether you would consider our innovative companion animal products.\\nAnd as we exit '24 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So overall, beyond '24, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect. But I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So that mix will continue to be favorable for us.\\nAnd as we get into the higher levels of production from monoclonal antibodies, they are also accretive to overall margins. And we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023.\\nAnd as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we're positioned to continue to expand.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So it looks like you're guiding back in the analogue math you're guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024.\\nBut you also did finish '23 lower than we would have expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You call out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation.\\nAny way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in '23? And then maybe what some of those onetime headwinds would have as an impact to 2024. Just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela. I don't believe you actually quantified the target.\\nSo I want to -- just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point. is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable. And especially that's for U.S., but then on the OUS side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of the Europe and it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So any color on what's going on internationally? Thanks.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure, Mike. Let me take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So take a look at margins. Indeed, in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion in margins.\\nKeep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact and about 80 of that is from FX. So you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly, a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our lifestyle team in Utah, and look, they've had a great year, and we expect lifestyle continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end.\\nSo that created a little bit of a mix. Yes, and as well as Librela outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit dilutive. So when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting '23. Most of the impact here is coming from FX about 80 basis points.\\nThe other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended FX is that has the impact on our on our finish here. If you take a look at FX, which is clearly nonoperational and you factor nonrecurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition. Those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here.\\nOf course, we don't forecast FX. So what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are. at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024.\\nAnd so that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past, and I will sit here and guess what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024, and that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes. For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue. Price is a pretty significant factor.\\nWe continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of 2 to 3 points. And perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And the Librela with the U.S. launch, clearly is going to be a significant factor.\\nCertainly, $44 million in the quarter and Q4 was, again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So you can model that out in terms of what that would translate to. We're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far as we discussed already.\\nIn international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets in addition to the U.S.\\n$44 million. So I think what we have to really take into account here is as we've been launching in markets. In Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out, you just focus on those markets that we've already launched.\\nWe're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters about give or take. So we're going to be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat.\\nOperator\\nWe'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\\nJon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nOK. Thanks guys. Good morning. Wendy, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of the easier 1Q '23 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half.\\nSo just -- how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And in the guidance for the full year, maybe GM, we're a little bit below what we were thinking. But SG&A expense despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So maybe you can just talk through those items why we're only seeing seems like low to mid-single-digit SG&A growth year over year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX? And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the U.S.\\n4Q '23 to 1Q '24 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks guys.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, John. If you look in Q1, certainly if you look at companion animal in the U.S., this is an easier comp.\\nWe had destocking in the first quarter last year. clearly something we look to see as an easier comp we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so I think if you look to balance complete the balance, but it's lifestyle growth both in the U.S.\\nas well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So that becomes a heavier I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions -- weather conditions in Australia, etc., are having an impact there. So I think if you balance those out and last point I'll make is, Librela, we are clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year.\\nSo Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Novella accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relative to speaking in Q1. So when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now we did make references to FX.\\nSo from a reported basis, that, again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple of weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. When FX de facto, hopefully, what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with the momentum as we exited Q4 and Q1, again, looking at U.S.\\ncompanion animal, but that's how I think about it. Now is Q1 is going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective, I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stock in that $12 million to $15 million. So even if you had a flat that means you grow by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here.\\nRight now, what I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDave Westenberg -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. So last year, we saw some discounting in front of the next gaurd combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of Elanco's Quattro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just a second one on just the DTC efforts on Librela.\\nI don't think there is DC allowed in Europe. But can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and maybe how that messaging can come out? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year, overall Trio grew 9%.\\nSo we're very pleased with that as we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in Trio for the year. So this obviously underscores everything and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So we do anticipate, obviously, a competitor entering I'm not exactly sure what -- how Elanco's Quattro will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product.\\nThey do mention taper, but you get tapeworm from fleas then we actually control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So we abused to having good competitors, obviously, with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional.\\nBut I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone entree is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market.\\nWhat we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, etc. So as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on what have we learned from Librela in Europe, so we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness.\\nI think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to encouraging them that there is a new product and then they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplift from direct-to-consumer advertising even when it's not branded. So I don't know what you want to add into that?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio been performing really well for us in the face of drug competition in the U.S. going to be more pleased. And to be gaining patient share in the face of competition.\\nI think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So look, there'll be some initial heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in with factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't hold in on specific reaction and so on, but we're very confident in our ability to grow continued growth franchise, and we're saying we're going to see mid- to single-digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid- to high single-digit growth for the franchise overall.\\nI guess, specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China. Could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that, that growth is obviously understated given the price -- if you're looking at the pre priced buy-in that we saw in late 2022.\\nAs we look at our guidance for mid- to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the U.S. You have pruritus.\\nThere is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market, seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products.\\nOur products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vest. And we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, build a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet and our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in Apoquel chewable and moving them to chewable pet owners really prefer.\\nWe've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the U.S. And we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term on the long-acting. So we are going to defend this franchise.\\nWe're confident in this franchise, our guidance of mid- to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the U.S. and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring life cycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. And one point on derm of course, we have a mid- to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance. of course, across a broad range of expectation there, there's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, etc., will play into that and the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow.\\nOur franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting to ignore nor improve at least through the first half of our year, and we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, little bit less so into the first half of '24, but still a headwind into the first half of '24.\\nYou continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices are remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So all those factors, of course, long term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade. But in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth.\\nIn fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBalaji Prasad -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. A couple. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points return revenue and 150 basis points on EPS is to be going from here.\\nWhy is FX severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean my general understanding is with $4 billion of -- $4-plus billion of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis received on Librela number. I wanted to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela's as promotion with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points, and what is the current status now with regard to your communication with FDA.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure Balaji, so I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I see you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification, would -- what you're talking about is a request for clarification on our promotional materials.\\nWe just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean this isn't uncommon. So I don't -- that was easily resolved last year, that was a minor issue.\\nBut Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. On currency dynamics. And again, we don't forecast FX. So we tend to report out what we see the impact is.\\nAnd the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina, if you follow Argentina, there have been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August. And there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those clearly is impact on top line that we've talked about. But there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time.\\nSo by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down to bottom line. So combinations volume. Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced in their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they value. That's what you're seeing play out.\\nBut really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\\nBrandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre priced buying in the quarter. Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that, maybe higher level.\\nIs there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us, you're still spending a lot of money in R&D and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre priced buying in our -- as we exit the year given where what our price increases are going to be I would say, compared to the prior year where there was higher than average reprice buying as in 2022 into 2023, which had the impact on '24, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of reprice buying exiting 2023. And that gave us really First, the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into but also, I would say, our quarter position walking into January 2024, we're certainly in a better position than, say, the prior year.\\nSo we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. And the question with regards to R&D. Obviously, we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health.\\nAnd if you look at the -- how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium and long term. In Animal Health, different than human health, that really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like life cycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apical Chewable, which will significantly support our key brands.\\nWe're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one- to three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long-acting. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term and really important new franchises as well, such as renal, chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes, there's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics as well as behind our livestock business.\\nlooking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nChris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth.\\nI know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. I'm just trying to get more color on what is the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still that capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex U.S.\\nFrom your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm showing a sense of like we're in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex U.S. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered as we've spoken about many times before to that business. I mean obviously, they're not inconsequential our view of 0% to 1% is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time.\\nSo I think we're really saying it's back to normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the U.S. But I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it.\\nBut we really sort of view the year as you look into the year for although we saw flat vet visits, we spot revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously, overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time. with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, etc. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the U.S., I think we're still early innings.\\nAnd really where I think we see the growth is right now, that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs. I mean, I think, obviously, at least somewhere -- I mean in my 50s, I will say, my hip hurts right now. But everyone doesn't know that it's around me.\\nAnd so the reality is osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're living and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think, is critical. So I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first-line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think we more -- we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise.\\nSo we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Stephen Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nUnknown speaker\\nThis is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First, on Librela. To what degree are U.S.\\ndebt capacity constraints, the headwind to longer-term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home administrative formulation? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So that capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on. But I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech.\\nAnd I think the industry is really focused, and we've been partnering with corporates the ABM with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far, globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a U.S. issue, it's global.\\nSo far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second question is with regard to home delivery. You want to take that one?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock and innovation, not only in our OA pain maps, but across our portfolio, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer-acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela will be the direction that will help with this, even though as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the maps.\\nI think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, etc. And that varies a bit, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\nNavann Ty -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions I have two ones on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela.\\nWith continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&As in addition to the current testing campaign -- and just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025. And then on Trio, can you help us explain the switches from to Mexico plus? Are they mostly from BI's homes like large rather than from Simparica Trio and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments, and we already started because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing the DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about year and a half or so ago. So we're able to leverage those investments, and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product.\\nThe gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023 and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage above. So 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it's below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see at those innovative levels, which is above -- well above the company. average.\\nSo hopefully, that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth, grew 17% in the U.S. in and we continue to gain patient share, which means, again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe effication has been in the market. for almost four years now.\\nSo we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know if Kristin, you want to add.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nWe're doing quite well of topics U.S. specifically with regards to puppies. I mean puppies are on the Trio label. So I just want to emphasize that.\\nI know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So I mean, really, if you're looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual agent customers to a triple combination and certainly a movement to more people from topical to oral. So there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies to answer that other part of your question.\\nOperator\\nThere seem to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nGreat. Thank you all so much for the questions. And honestly, your continued interest in Zoetis. I want to undergo that the enduring strength of the human animal bond for pet owners expectations of human-quality healthcare for pets and the need for safe and secure food supply all underscore that animal health industry is essential and very durable.\\nWe remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just a line and to grow operational revenue by mid- to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio, and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises. The animal health industry is resilient even in times of uncertainty, and we are poised to navigate these challenges because our portfolio diversity, our commitment to exceptional customer experience, operational excellence, and agility, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in future calls.\\nThanks a must for joining us today, guys. Have a great day.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\n\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nGood morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.\\nWith the exception of any participant's questions asked, during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, vice president, investor relations.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, chairman and chief executive officer; Bob Funck, executive vice president for finance; and Phil Boudreau, senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results, as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time to position the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier, given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing experienced a slowdown to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world placed a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffered during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient.\\nIt was also during this time that we created a multibillion dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders. But we knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead.\\nWe pulled forward our accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale-down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company. Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions.\\nAnd this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution.\\nAnd in medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals, along with several new opportunities, to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year.\\nSales, excluding COVID testing, grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11%, higher than our original guidance of high single-digit growth. Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic. Turning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecasted sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business. I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S.\\nwas driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader. International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\\nTurning to established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results. Moving to diagnostics, growth in rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing.\\nThe flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering. Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations.\\nThe system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales, led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis.\\nIn heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. So, in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year.\\nWe outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil?\\nPhil Boudreau -- Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which as expected reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for 2024, today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024.\\nFor the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice end to the year here. So, Robert, you know, pre-COVID Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically. As you mentioned, you're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base.\\nWhat has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions and I'll leave it there for my one question. Thank you.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and, quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business, I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these four business, and their underlying attractiveness still is, you know, is very sustainable. So, strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these four segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in.\\nSo, I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging, you know, geographies and different markets.\\nAnd they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think you know, even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their margin profile by 300 basis points. So, a pretty strong position, strong team. And then, you know, we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which, historically, hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets.\\nIt's probably been more of a developed market place. So, I think that's going to, you know, provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think, did an incredible job here, as we said at the beginning of last year, regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product.\\nBut even adult -- our adult business. Our adult business has increased $1 billion, you know, since pre-pandemic. And it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion growing high single digits.\\nThere's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that, you know, command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also. Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well.\\nWe've talked about, you know, our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio and, quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. And our rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to, you know, put through those instruments so -- and then, medical devices, you know, historically, was in that high single digit growth.\\nI think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-sized business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like [Inaudible] or EP, structural heart, ADC, I mean those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices, our CRM and vascular businesses that were, you know, showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4. With CRM, I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology.\\nOn vascular, it's been a combination of adding and organically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segment. So, I think that's really, you know, in a nutshell, across all these very four attractive segments, we've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you know, you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth. And they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten, you know, more growth opportunities within.\\nSo, I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about, you know, accelerating sales but, you know, not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. You know, our core business grew EPS last year, you know, 40-plus percent.\\nWe're forecasting double-digit earnings-per-share growth, you know, this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So, I'd say, yeah, you know, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics.\\nBut, you know, we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have. On the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range. But it's only January, so I think this is a good starting point.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nSuper helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and I echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. I was hoping to just follow up on your comments, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. You know, Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally.\\nBut was hoping to just -- thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business and that 30 to 50 basis point range, was hoping you just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in '24 and into the outyears? Thanks for taking the question.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre-pandemic level.\\nAnd I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we managed, you know, very well strategically the spending piece of it. You know, we accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then, we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was, you know, was growing pretty significantly here. So, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line.\\nAnd that is, you know, I think about our big five activities this year in the company. You know, and we can do all five of them at the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. You know, we're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, you know, roughly around 75 basis points.\\nAnd, you know, there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So, you know, every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis, they all get reported out.\\nSo, there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs. Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So, you know, whether it's commodity costs, you know, freight and distribution, you know, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now, and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, you know, turning into tailwinds. So, that helps.\\nAnd then, the other part here is just, you know, I'd say portfolio mix. So, as some of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher-margin businesses. And, you know, they provide that, you know, that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So, I think this provides a nice -- you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year.\\nBut I expect, over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic -- you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's for me it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. You know, we could target, you know, 50, 75. You know, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want.\\nBut, you know, that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to do -- to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. So, I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. So, our big opportunity here is gross margin, and, you know, we're all over it.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches.\\nSo, we'd love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the U.S. EP business as we see some PFA launches this year? Thanks for taking the questions.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Well, I think we've showed a pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition. It's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story.\\nU.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP.\\nBut the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than more than offset that. So, it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So, you know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think, is at the core.\\nYou know, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is, you know, the flexible tip combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's, you know, outcomes for the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world. And then, on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers.\\nAnd, yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So, I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth. As we look to, you know, more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S., listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology.\\nI think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake in usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first -- at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment. And then, from there, then kind of moving past that.\\nSo, you know, right now, I think -- I guess that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that, you know, it will follow a similar pattern. And then, the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground, you know, with the technology.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThank you, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, maybe I could ask on Libre. You know, this is the most successful medical device.\\nAt the conference just a few weeks ago, in San Fran, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward and targets. You know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in '24 and beyond. And one question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data, it's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales, or at least prescriptions are flattening out yet the sales keep growing.\\nHow do we think about the discrepancy there? And how big is the Medicare DME business and, you know, the growth we're getting there from basal? Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Strong growth in Q4, under 1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%.\\nAnd I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But, you know, being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\\nYou know, the growth is going to come from, I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, I mean, a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, OK, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us, but -- and I also think it's multiyear.\\nSo, I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely, you know, two plus-years easily. And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you reference IQVIA, Ravi.\\nSeven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. So, it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where, you know, that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution in growth.\\nI think right now, in the U.S, most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private commercial. Medicare represents about a third of the market. So, I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the build the awareness, you know, build the traveling experience with primary care.\\nAnd that's what we're doing, that's what we have been doing quite frankly for some time. So, it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. And like I said, you know, easily two-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have Robbie, is, you know, looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access, which is that of, you know, pump connectivity, I think this represents a great opportunity for us.\\nIf you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You've got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year. And that patient segment has -- you know, we haven't been able to target it. But now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us.\\nYou know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? Recently, there was an independent third-party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head-to-head study that was published a few weeks ago showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's marred. So, I look at that and I say, OK, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the, you know, best solution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment.\\nSo, I look at the basal, I look at the pump. It's probably good drivers for us, you know, in '24, '25. But, you know, we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. To your question on IQVIA, you know, I think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market.\\nSo, you know, the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So, maybe that's what you're seeing.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate the thoughts.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since this story seems to be very much about wine growth, I haven't heard you reference the Fab 5, one of my favorite analogies in a long time.\\nSo, just wanted to -- and maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab 5 and where, you know, how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth, for 2024? Thanks so much.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products. And we didn't think about calling them that because there was going to be a flash in the pan for, you know, one or two years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company, you know, over the next few years.\\nAnd, you know, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth, and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about, you know, about a point of growth, total Abbott, you know, contribution. So, they're definitely stepping up. And I'd say some of them, I would call market-creating opportunities.\\nTricuspid, I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, you know, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, you know, generating referral pathways. You know, we know how to do this. And we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, you know, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to, you know, market expansion development and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion.\\nAnd, you know, these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments, you know, that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVI space, AVEIR in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that, you know, we're coming in and will have different value propositions. I think AVEIR's got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market.\\nAnd the value proposition for AVEIR, I think, is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implant or to the patient. So, I expect a lot from AVEIR in terms of growth. I expect a lot from, you know, Navitor. And, you know, we're going to be expanding, so we'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan.\\nAnd so, we're investing in those areas. And, yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it, and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year, and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company.\\nSo, you know, that being said, I will say, you know, those are great products, and they take a lot of focus. But we still have -- you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users, this year also. You know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution.\\nWe put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars, in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre. We're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So, yeah, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions.\\nBut there's a lot in the chamber here. And I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nThank you. Very thorough. Thank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year, or nice end to last year, too. So, here's a question I have. In nutrition, you've done a great job of, sounds like, returning to normalcy.\\nI'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track, or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single-digit segment growth category. Thanks.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Yeah, I think kudos to the team here. We set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year, to get to market leadership. In our October call, we had already confirmed that.\\nAnd I'd say over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the No. 2. Yeah, I mean, I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, you know, given the strength of the portfolio of the team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share.\\nYou know, I don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio. So, I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have pre-pandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can, you know, be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down.\\nAnd I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position, with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on healthcare and on nutrition. So, I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher-end 6% range going forward. But I think, right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial-year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range and then as we move into next year, you know, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the adult segment and what is that going to do for us.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Robert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M&A.\\nLooking at the balance sheet, phenomenal position. You at least have a minimum of 20 billion of firepower. Abbott hasn't done any large deals in the last few years. So, my question is, how do you see the opportunity for larger-size deals? What is Abbott's appetite for a larger size, more meaningful transaction?\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet, and it provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So, that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top-line gaps that might be there.\\nSo, that allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then, like you said, you've done the math. We've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good.\\nYou know, profitability matters. You know, earnings matter. And, you know, when you get into these larger-size deals, you know, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top-line play. I think they're harder nowadays.\\nYou know, you look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together, you know, spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought, you know, this business would, you know, would impact the company. So, I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital.\\nAnd -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top-line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to fill a top-line gap.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOperator, we'll take one more question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our last question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some of the companies are kind of calling out above-normal growth.\\nSo, curious, Robert, if you look at your med device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated, you know, catch-ups still coming through? Or do you think this is kind of more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious in some of your thoughts on the overall market.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, I don't think that that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio, I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So, I think there was some disruption, we've talked about it, in some parts of -- some procedures that require a little bit more pre-op planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean, I think those -- that, combined with the labor shortages that occurred, you know, 2022, I think that that that probably slowed a few of them down. But I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that.\\nI just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see, you know, procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in, you know, CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, too, so -- we've seen that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis. A lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our core lab business is actually in the hospital. So, we also get to see that, too.\\nAnd, you know, I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So, we try and triangulate this. I just see this as, you know, procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients, I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve.\\nSome are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and, you know, market positions, etc. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nOK. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023 in many ways. It sort of represented this transition year regarding, you know, the coming down of COVID.\\nI think we did a really good job at managing, you know, the scale-up and the scale-down. A lot of healthcare companies actually participated in trying to solve, you know, the COVID problem. And I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now a transition from being driven by COVID testing to, once again, being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company.\\nWe deliver double-digit organic sales growth on every base business on every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline, we talked a bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024.\\nAnd as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January, so we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOK. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m.\\nCentral Time today on Abbott investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\\nOperator\\nThank you.

(NASDAQ:ALPN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 23, 2023\\n\\nOperator: Welcome to the Alpine Immune Sciences Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Temre Johnson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alpine. Ms. Johnson, I'll now turn the call over to you.\\n\\nTemre Johnson: Thank you, Carrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Dr. Mitchell Gold, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Stanford Peng, President and Head of Research and Development; and Paul Rickey, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mitch, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and involve risk and uncertainties as a result and the timing of events, potential publication of clinical data and expectations regarding the sufficiency of cash and investment could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risk and uncertainties. You may refer to the most recent SEC filings regarding risk factors associated with these statements. Mitch, please go ahead.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you, Temre. Alpine is off to a strong start in 2023 driven by progress in the development of povetacicept, a potentially best-in-class dual inhibitor of BAFF and APRIL cytokines with a convenient once every four weeks simultaneous dosing regimen that we believe has the potential manifestations with erythematosus, autoimmune inflammatory diseases. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved a significant milestone for Povetacicept with the initiation of the RUBY-3 basket study, a first patient-based study for the program, it will study Povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis indications including IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and primary membranous nephropathy. Although still early in development, investigator enthusiasm for the program, and interest in participating in the RUBY-3 study is highly encouraged.\\n\\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\\n\\nIn addition to RUBY-3, we are planning to initiate the the RUBY-4 basket study an autoimmune autoimmune cytopenias in the second quarter of 2023. This includes the autoimmune thrombocytopenia, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinin disease. We expect to share initial data from both the RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 basket studies by the end of this year. We see broad development potential for Povetacicept in multiple indications beyond the basket studies, including our RUBY-2 study systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as neurologic, dermatologic and other rheumatic disease indications. We recently signed a collaboration with Truveta to help accelerate the broad development of Povetacicept across these multiple indications. But then increasingly competitive and sometimes challenging clinical trial Truveta gives us access to its 28th partner members, who provide 16% of patient care in the United States.\\n\\nIn addition to our own efforts, we will leverage Truveta's platform and analytics capabilities to more quickly identify and recruit study participants for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 with the potential to benefit most Povetacicept. We will evoke Povetacicept has the potential to be a pipeline and project with a strong balance sheet and promising preclinical and Phase 1 healthy volunteer data, we are rapidly moving forward with a robust development plan for Povetacicept. And now I will turn over the call over to Stanford to review our progress, provide updates on our broad plans for POVI in more detail. Stanford? Thank you, Mitch. As a reminder, Povetacicept is an Fc fusion of a variant TACI domain, engineered to inhibit more potently the April and BAFF cytokines with wild-type TACI IV fusion proteins.\\n\\nThe clinical relevance of these cytokines continues to grow in multiple autoimmune diseases with proof-of-concept and/or encouraging clinical data is \\u0080\\u0093 in diseases such as systemic lupus, lupus nephritis, IgA, nephropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and Myasthenia gravis. In preclinical studies, Povetacicept has superior to wild-type wild-type TACI IV comparators, as well as inhibitors of only April and BAFF demonstrates potent activity in multiple disease relevant animal health. At Phase 1 human study in adult healthy volunteers, Povetacicept has been well tolerated. It has demonstrated excellent PK and PD, including dose-related reductions in circulating antibody-secreting cells, and serum in globulins as well as the IgA nephropathy relevant biomarker, galactose-deficient IgA1.\\n\\nAgain initial multi dose experiences in each population we are initially focusing on two basket studies. The first is RUBY-3, an open-label basket study in autoimmune glomerulonephritides. This study has just recently begun enrolling. Second, we shortly follow with RUBY-4, an open-label basket study in autoimmune cytopenias. The initial data from these studies we anticipate the ability next year to begin multiple Phase 2 studies including one in systemic lupus erythematosus known as RUBY-2. Additional studies in other disease areas are of great interest, including nephrology or hematology, urology, dermatology, as well as rheumatology besides lupus. Some of these we envision could proceed via an accelerated approval pathway. In summary, Povetacicept can potently target both the April and BAFF cytokines in a unique highly differentiated way.\\n\\nstudy that has broad development potential. We look forward to sharing additional data as the program progresses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul Rickey.\\n\\nPaul Rickey: Thank you, Stanford. I will now provide an overview of our financials for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized under our collaboration programs for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $2.8 million, compared to $4.5 million in 2021. The decrease primarily related to lower revenue recognized under our collaboration with AbbVie, partially offset by revenue recognized in the services performed in connection with our collaboration with Horizon, which was executed late in 2021. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31st 2022, were $18.8 million, compared to $15.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related due to increased head count to support our ongoing and planned clinical development programs.\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter ended December, 31st 2022 we're $4.4 million, compared to $4.5 million for 2021. The company reported net losses of $18.9 million and $15.2 million for the fourth quarter ended 20 22 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31st 2022, Alpine's cash and investments totaled $273.4 million, which we anticipate should be sufficient on our planned operation through 2025. I will now hand the call back to Mitch.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Paul. As Stanford highlighted, we are highly encouraged by the progress of Povetacicept, a milestone that we believe is the only truly potent dual /APRIL/BAFF inhibitor. As a result, we believe in the broad potential for the program may become an important immune disease-modifying therapy, present multiple be some mediated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In closing, we believe we have laid a strong foundation to walk to the next phase of Alpine as we progress throughout the course of this year and into next year. Operator, now open the phone for questions.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And we\\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Mike Ulz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on getting the RUBY-3 study going here. Maybe just a question in terms of both basket studies and maybe you can comment on how you\\u2019re currently thinking about dosing. And if there\\u2019s any additional dosing work you plan to do before getting into the indication specific cohorts in the basket studies. And I guess, part of why I\\u2019m asking I looked on clinicaltrials.gov and I noticed some differences in the dosing that you\\u2019re using for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yes. Maybe I\\u2019ll the first part of that Mike. Thanks for the question and I\\u2019ll ask Stanford to walk you. So just as a reminder, RUBY-3 has two different dose escalations that will be going through both an 80 milligram cohort, and a 240 milligram cohort. And RUBY-4 will be going directly into the 240 milligram dosing group. So there will be no 80 milligram cohort in that group.\\n\\nStanford Peng : That\\u2019s correct. And so, there\\u2019s no, there\\u2019s no pre-indication, sort of phase of the study will be going directly into all three diseases in both trials at the doses that Mitch mentioned.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Got it. That\\u2019s helpful and maybe just one more question from me. I noticed in the press release. For RUBY-2 you plan to sort of start that study in mid 2024 and you make a comment on some \\u2013 based on some enabling data from RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 studies. Maybe you can just clarify what you\\u2019re hoping to learn from those studies that will enable you to start RUBY-2?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Primarily multi-dose data, as you know the phase one study we ran into those pending dose studies. In addition, it will give us greater confidence in to dose selection for the Phase 2 let\\u2019s say.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Good. Got it. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Mike.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Tara Bancroft with Cowen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nTara Bancroft : Hi guys. And thanks for taking the question. So, I\\u2019m wondering what do you expect the rate of enrollment to be in the basket studies now, especially given the Truveta collaboration? And when do you think that you might reach full enrollment? Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Well, we\\u2019ll update it. Enrolling in general has been a challenging in a clinical trial environment to enroll patients. That being said, I\\u2019m pretty pleased with the way RUBY-3 has started. We are getting a lot of investigator interest and a lot of patient interest and I think you saw that in our comments in the press release today. So that in and of itself is encouraging. But I would say it\\u2019s purely on start of that trial but that trial continues we expect it to enroll fairly rapidly. The Truveta collaboration, I\\u2019ll talk a little bit about, Tara I appreciate you bringing that up. You know, I think we welcome to enroll the trials in a very traditional way we work with \\u2013 and we engage investigators in a really active way to identify patients to bring up in the trials.\\n\\nI think one of the things as an industry that we\\u2019ve done fairly poorly is using some of the new electronic medical record systems, and work organization across multiple centers to identify them quickly and then include patients in the clinical trials. Honestly, Truveta is a Seattle-based company. We know them well and work with them to kind of enable their member their member partners io identify patients that are relevant for RUBY-3 and we look forward to enroll them in our clinical trials.\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Thomas Smith with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Brian Conley on for Tom. I believe you just responded to a question about Truveta, but just curious if there are any other gating factors or any other obstacles or challenging factors you\\u2019re encountering as you\\u2019re progressing the basket trials. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah. Thanks Brian. No, I think the reason we put Truveta in place was to be proactive at the start of the study. These are things that you want to be in front of. I would say our traditional efforts are looking at let us exceed the trial and get started in terms of law I think because awareness on the targets and strong awareness in the space. And we have a great group of investigators that we have brought in. The reason we brought Truveta onboard is we want to ask \\u2013 add it on probably one of the number one, do it at the beginning of the trial. And two, as we push into the Phase 2 study next year that\\u2019s clearly resulted in accelerated approval. We wanted the collaboration between us and Truveta to be kind of fully integrated, so we can leverage it as we move into these studies.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Mark Breidenbach with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a quick couple from me. First on the Truveta collaboration. Have you any thoughts on what they\\u2019re getting in return for helping optimize enrollment of RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: I am sorry. I lost you one second. Can you say that one more time?\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Yeah, sorry. What\\u2019s Truveta getting in return for helping you guys enroll in RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Let me take in traditional services agreement. So there\\u2019s kind of a baseline fee that we pay them and then as they enroll a certain number of patients, they have certain objectives that they need to meet to be able to generate service fees and as a result of that. So, it\\u2019s not any direct measures on services security.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. And with regard to the upcoming presentation at WCN from RUBY-1, is there anything in that presentation that we haven\\u2019t already seen? What\\u2019s kind of going to be the focus of that upcoming presentation next week?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Our main goal is to \\u2013 reader awareness we didn\\u2019t present there last year that I am sure you\\u2019re aware, but make sure that, just build awareness about the target and the molecule with that audience, as it will be updated Phase 1 data with regard to additional follow-up is some of the subjects. Although the general conclusions about change that you can tell us some of our preceding comments.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. Maybe one last one for me. I know, you mention the 80 mg and 240 mg dosing cohorts in RUBY-3. Can you just comment on the dosing schedules and how those compare to, let\\u2019s say, if we use povetacicept as the closest equivalent or competing drug, how will the dosing schedules compare between your drug and RemeGen\\u2019s? Thank you.\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, our trials both are doing things in a two four week dose regimen and as at all doses, for both doses being tested. As far as we are aware, RemeGen is 160 milligrams of Sub-Q weekly and it appears to be the doses for all their pivotal trials. So, when the person where Q4 versus Q1 week. As you know, we start to talk about best-in-class potential for POVI where the key things that differentiate us is, one that we were potent, two that we have a much more convenient dosing schedule and the fact that we cover both cytokines more completely than either of the wild-type TACI \\u0080\\u0093 in three broad development plan going forward.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our last question from the line of with Joe Pantginis with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks taking the question. Wanted to get a little more color if you can regarding the end-of-year initial data from both RUBY- 3 and RUBY-4. Is this going to be essentially, early response type of data for each type of indication or can we get more than that initially with regard to say any translational or PD data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, we\\u2019ll be focusing quite a bit on both traditional endpoints, as well as biomarker-related data. So, PD endpoints, including immunoglobulintarget, cytokine targets, as well as biomarkers or things like a Gd-IgA1 in IG nephropathy as each of these indications has their respective antibody that we will be looking at. So we\\u2019ll be looking all of that and look forward to be able to report that early this year.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : That\\u2019s great. And do you think you could just remind, I mean, since it\\u2019s a basket concept, how many per indication you\\u2019re looking for and how many you think that might deliver for the initial data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: It\\u2019s a basket trial. We\\u2019ll see harmonization that I can say that we\\u2019re getting interest. The recent RUBY-3 so far we are getting interest in across all the different subtypes, lupus nephritis and primary membranous nephropathy. Exactly how that mix is going to shake out surely to say right now, but early on we\\u2019re pretty pleased with the mix of interest that\\u2019s coming into the trial.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Sure, got it. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: There are no for the questions, Dr. Gold. I\\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you operator. Thank you all for taking part in today\\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you in upcoming investor and medical meetings and providing updates in the months ahead. Thank you and have a great afternoon.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our call today. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Operator\\nWelcome to the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, vice president of investor relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.\\nIn addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\\nSteve Frank -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our chief executive officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S.\\nGAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13th, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin. \\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S.\\nand 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises.\\nWe don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the No. 1 selling OA pain product in Europe.\\nAt Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth.\\nSimilarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain maps. Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism.\\nWe remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.\\nAs we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance.\\nOur dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market.\\nOur focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition.\\nI want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders.\\nWhile there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you. Now let me hand it over to Wetteny.\\nWetteny?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S.\\nand international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animals was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction among both vets and pet owners.\\nOur key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals.\\nAdjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while international segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%.\\nWe saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.\\nSimparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S.\\nand international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from Draxxin and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims.\\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal pre price buy-in at the end of last year.\\nIn the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.\\nMoving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S.\\nsales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S.\\nsales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S.\\nWe have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%.\\nGrowth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges and in advance of a than expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and a significant advantage of being first to market. Key dermatology products sales in the U.S.\\nwere $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. Simparica franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our U.S.\\ncompanion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.\\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\\nGrowth in our OA pain products was equally driven by full focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis.\\nWe continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness.\\nThis growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio.\\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition-related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation.\\nR&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.\\nAdjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders.\\nFor the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024.\\nPlease note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points.\\nwith significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume.\\nWe expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally.\\nOur current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio.\\nFor livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth.\\nFor companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio.\\nWe expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination animal parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.\\nAdjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix.\\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million.\\nThis is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market.\\nand growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.\\nTo summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future.\\nAs we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. So can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the U.S. and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter to quarter.\\nAnd then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp-up of Librela that weigh on margins. But can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher-margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer-term margin leverage. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yeah. We were very pleased with how we did with Librela in this first full quarter of launch in Q4.\\nAs you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we -- given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected in line with our expectations. So that makes us really confident as we go into the year.\\nwe're looking at what -- your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clicks. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the No.\\n1 selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the U.S. as well. So we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the U.S.\\nSo I'll let Wetteny take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed, there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond, we do have Librela in 2023, as we've said at Investor Day, if you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand. They started being dilutive to the overall company average, for example, in 2023. As we go through 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below whether you would consider our innovative companion animal products.\\nAnd as we exit '24 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So overall, beyond '24, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect. But I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So that mix will continue to be favorable for us.\\nAnd as we get into the higher levels of production from monoclonal antibodies, they are also accretive to overall margins. And we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023.\\nAnd as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we're positioned to continue to expand.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So it looks like you're guiding back in the analogue math you're guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024.\\nBut you also did finish '23 lower than we would have expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You call out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation.\\nAny way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in '23? And then maybe what some of those onetime headwinds would have as an impact to 2024. Just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela. I don't believe you actually quantified the target.\\nSo I want to -- just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point. is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable. And especially that's for U.S., but then on the OUS side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of the Europe and it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So any color on what's going on internationally? Thanks.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure, Mike. Let me take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So take a look at margins. Indeed, in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion in margins.\\nKeep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact and about 80 of that is from FX. So you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly, a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our lifestyle team in Utah, and look, they've had a great year, and we expect lifestyle continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end.\\nSo that created a little bit of a mix. Yes, and as well as Librela outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit dilutive. So when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting '23. Most of the impact here is coming from FX about 80 basis points.\\nThe other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended FX is that has the impact on our on our finish here. If you take a look at FX, which is clearly nonoperational and you factor nonrecurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition. Those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here.\\nOf course, we don't forecast FX. So what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are. at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024.\\nAnd so that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past, and I will sit here and guess what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024, and that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes. For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue. Price is a pretty significant factor.\\nWe continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of 2 to 3 points. And perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And the Librela with the U.S. launch, clearly is going to be a significant factor.\\nCertainly, $44 million in the quarter and Q4 was, again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So you can model that out in terms of what that would translate to. We're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far as we discussed already.\\nIn international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets in addition to the U.S.\\n$44 million. So I think what we have to really take into account here is as we've been launching in markets. In Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out, you just focus on those markets that we've already launched.\\nWe're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters about give or take. So we're going to be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat.\\nOperator\\nWe'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\\nJon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nOK. Thanks guys. Good morning. Wendy, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of the easier 1Q '23 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half.\\nSo just -- how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And in the guidance for the full year, maybe GM, we're a little bit below what we were thinking. But SG&A expense despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So maybe you can just talk through those items why we're only seeing seems like low to mid-single-digit SG&A growth year over year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX? And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the U.S.\\n4Q '23 to 1Q '24 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks guys.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, John. If you look in Q1, certainly if you look at companion animal in the U.S., this is an easier comp.\\nWe had destocking in the first quarter last year. clearly something we look to see as an easier comp we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so I think if you look to balance complete the balance, but it's lifestyle growth both in the U.S.\\nas well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So that becomes a heavier I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions -- weather conditions in Australia, etc., are having an impact there. So I think if you balance those out and last point I'll make is, Librela, we are clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year.\\nSo Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Novella accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relative to speaking in Q1. So when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now we did make references to FX.\\nSo from a reported basis, that, again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple of weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. When FX de facto, hopefully, what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with the momentum as we exited Q4 and Q1, again, looking at U.S.\\ncompanion animal, but that's how I think about it. Now is Q1 is going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective, I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stock in that $12 million to $15 million. So even if you had a flat that means you grow by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here.\\nRight now, what I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDave Westenberg -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. So last year, we saw some discounting in front of the next gaurd combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of Elanco's Quattro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just a second one on just the DTC efforts on Librela.\\nI don't think there is DC allowed in Europe. But can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and maybe how that messaging can come out? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year, overall Trio grew 9%.\\nSo we're very pleased with that as we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in Trio for the year. So this obviously underscores everything and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So we do anticipate, obviously, a competitor entering I'm not exactly sure what -- how Elanco's Quattro will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product.\\nThey do mention taper, but you get tapeworm from fleas then we actually control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So we abused to having good competitors, obviously, with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional.\\nBut I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone entree is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market.\\nWhat we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, etc. So as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on what have we learned from Librela in Europe, so we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness.\\nI think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to encouraging them that there is a new product and then they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplift from direct-to-consumer advertising even when it's not branded. So I don't know what you want to add into that?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio been performing really well for us in the face of drug competition in the U.S. going to be more pleased. And to be gaining patient share in the face of competition.\\nI think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So look, there'll be some initial heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in with factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't hold in on specific reaction and so on, but we're very confident in our ability to grow continued growth franchise, and we're saying we're going to see mid- to single-digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid- to high single-digit growth for the franchise overall.\\nI guess, specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China. Could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that, that growth is obviously understated given the price -- if you're looking at the pre priced buy-in that we saw in late 2022.\\nAs we look at our guidance for mid- to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the U.S. You have pruritus.\\nThere is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market, seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products.\\nOur products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vest. And we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, build a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet and our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in Apoquel chewable and moving them to chewable pet owners really prefer.\\nWe've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the U.S. And we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term on the long-acting. So we are going to defend this franchise.\\nWe're confident in this franchise, our guidance of mid- to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the U.S. and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring life cycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. And one point on derm of course, we have a mid- to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance. of course, across a broad range of expectation there, there's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, etc., will play into that and the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow.\\nOur franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting to ignore nor improve at least through the first half of our year, and we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, little bit less so into the first half of '24, but still a headwind into the first half of '24.\\nYou continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices are remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So all those factors, of course, long term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade. But in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth.\\nIn fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBalaji Prasad -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. A couple. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points return revenue and 150 basis points on EPS is to be going from here.\\nWhy is FX severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean my general understanding is with $4 billion of -- $4-plus billion of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis received on Librela number. I wanted to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela's as promotion with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points, and what is the current status now with regard to your communication with FDA.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure Balaji, so I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I see you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification, would -- what you're talking about is a request for clarification on our promotional materials.\\nWe just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean this isn't uncommon. So I don't -- that was easily resolved last year, that was a minor issue.\\nBut Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. On currency dynamics. And again, we don't forecast FX. So we tend to report out what we see the impact is.\\nAnd the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina, if you follow Argentina, there have been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August. And there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those clearly is impact on top line that we've talked about. But there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time.\\nSo by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down to bottom line. So combinations volume. Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced in their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they value. That's what you're seeing play out.\\nBut really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\\nBrandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre priced buying in the quarter. Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that, maybe higher level.\\nIs there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us, you're still spending a lot of money in R&D and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre priced buying in our -- as we exit the year given where what our price increases are going to be I would say, compared to the prior year where there was higher than average reprice buying as in 2022 into 2023, which had the impact on '24, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of reprice buying exiting 2023. And that gave us really First, the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into but also, I would say, our quarter position walking into January 2024, we're certainly in a better position than, say, the prior year.\\nSo we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. And the question with regards to R&D. Obviously, we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health.\\nAnd if you look at the -- how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium and long term. In Animal Health, different than human health, that really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like life cycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apical Chewable, which will significantly support our key brands.\\nWe're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one- to three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long-acting. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term and really important new franchises as well, such as renal, chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes, there's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics as well as behind our livestock business.\\nlooking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nChris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth.\\nI know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. I'm just trying to get more color on what is the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still that capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex U.S.\\nFrom your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm showing a sense of like we're in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex U.S. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered as we've spoken about many times before to that business. I mean obviously, they're not inconsequential our view of 0% to 1% is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time.\\nSo I think we're really saying it's back to normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the U.S. But I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it.\\nBut we really sort of view the year as you look into the year for although we saw flat vet visits, we spot revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously, overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time. with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, etc. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the U.S., I think we're still early innings.\\nAnd really where I think we see the growth is right now, that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs. I mean, I think, obviously, at least somewhere -- I mean in my 50s, I will say, my hip hurts right now. But everyone doesn't know that it's around me.\\nAnd so the reality is osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're living and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think, is critical. So I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first-line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think we more -- we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise.\\nSo we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Stephen Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nUnknown speaker\\nThis is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First, on Librela. To what degree are U.S.\\ndebt capacity constraints, the headwind to longer-term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home administrative formulation? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So that capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on. But I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech.\\nAnd I think the industry is really focused, and we've been partnering with corporates the ABM with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far, globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a U.S. issue, it's global.\\nSo far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second question is with regard to home delivery. You want to take that one?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock and innovation, not only in our OA pain maps, but across our portfolio, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer-acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela will be the direction that will help with this, even though as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the maps.\\nI think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, etc. And that varies a bit, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\nNavann Ty -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions I have two ones on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela.\\nWith continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&As in addition to the current testing campaign -- and just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025. And then on Trio, can you help us explain the switches from to Mexico plus? Are they mostly from BI's homes like large rather than from Simparica Trio and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments, and we already started because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing the DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about year and a half or so ago. So we're able to leverage those investments, and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product.\\nThe gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023 and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage above. So 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it's below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see at those innovative levels, which is above -- well above the company. average.\\nSo hopefully, that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth, grew 17% in the U.S. in and we continue to gain patient share, which means, again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe effication has been in the market. for almost four years now.\\nSo we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know if Kristin, you want to add.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nWe're doing quite well of topics U.S. specifically with regards to puppies. I mean puppies are on the Trio label. So I just want to emphasize that.\\nI know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So I mean, really, if you're looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual agent customers to a triple combination and certainly a movement to more people from topical to oral. So there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies to answer that other part of your question.\\nOperator\\nThere seem to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nGreat. Thank you all so much for the questions. And honestly, your continued interest in Zoetis. I want to undergo that the enduring strength of the human animal bond for pet owners expectations of human-quality healthcare for pets and the need for safe and secure food supply all underscore that animal health industry is essential and very durable.\\nWe remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just a line and to grow operational revenue by mid- to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio, and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises.

Have a great day.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\n\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nGood morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.\\nWith the exception of any participant's questions asked, during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, vice president, investor relations.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, chairman and chief executive officer; Bob Funck, executive vice president for finance; and Phil Boudreau, senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results, as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time to position the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier, given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing experienced a slowdown to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world placed a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffered during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient.\\nIt was also during this time that we created a multibillion dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders. But we knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead.\\nWe pulled forward our accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale-down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company. Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions.\\nAnd this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution.\\nAnd in medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals, along with several new opportunities, to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year.\\nSales, excluding COVID testing, grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11%, higher than our original guidance of high single-digit growth. Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic. Turning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecasted sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business. I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S.\\nwas driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader. International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\\nTurning to established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results. Moving to diagnostics, growth in rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing.\\nThe flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering. Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations.\\nThe system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales, led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis.\\nIn heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. So, in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year.\\nWe outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil?\\nPhil Boudreau -- Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which as expected reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for 2024, today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024.\\nFor the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice end to the year here. So, Robert, you know, pre-COVID Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically. As you mentioned, you're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base.\\nWhat has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions and I'll leave it there for my one question. Thank you.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and, quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business, I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these four business, and their underlying attractiveness still is, you know, is very sustainable. So, strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these four segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in.\\nSo, I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging, you know, geographies and different markets.\\nAnd they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think you know, even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their margin profile by 300 basis points. So, a pretty strong position, strong team. And then, you know, we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which, historically, hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets.\\nIt's probably been more of a developed market place. So, I think that's going to, you know, provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think, did an incredible job here, as we said at the beginning of last year, regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product.\\nBut even adult -- our adult business. Our adult business has increased $1 billion, you know, since pre-pandemic. And it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion growing high single digits.\\nThere's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that, you know, command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also. Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well.\\nWe've talked about, you know, our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio and, quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. And our rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to, you know, put through those instruments so -- and then, medical devices, you know, historically, was in that high single digit growth.\\nI think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-sized business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like [Inaudible] or EP, structural heart, ADC, I mean those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices, our CRM and vascular businesses that were, you know, showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4. With CRM, I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology.\\nOn vascular, it's been a combination of adding and organically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segment. So, I think that's really, you know, in a nutshell, across all these very four attractive segments, we've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you know, you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth. And they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten, you know, more growth opportunities within.\\nSo, I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about, you know, accelerating sales but, you know, not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. You know, our core business grew EPS last year, you know, 40-plus percent.\\nWe're forecasting double-digit earnings-per-share growth, you know, this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So, I'd say, yeah, you know, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics.\\nBut, you know, we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have. On the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range. But it's only January, so I think this is a good starting point.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nSuper helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and I echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. I was hoping to just follow up on your comments, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. You know, Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally.\\nBut was hoping to just -- thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business and that 30 to 50 basis point range, was hoping you just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in '24 and into the outyears? Thanks for taking the question.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre-pandemic level.\\nAnd I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we managed, you know, very well strategically the spending piece of it. You know, we accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then, we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was, you know, was growing pretty significantly here. So, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line.\\nAnd that is, you know, I think about our big five activities this year in the company. You know, and we can do all five of them at the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. You know, we're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, you know, roughly around 75 basis points.\\nAnd, you know, there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So, you know, every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis, they all get reported out.\\nSo, there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs. Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So, you know, whether it's commodity costs, you know, freight and distribution, you know, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now, and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, you know, turning into tailwinds. So, that helps.\\nAnd then, the other part here is just, you know, I'd say portfolio mix. So, as some of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher-margin businesses. And, you know, they provide that, you know, that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So, I think this provides a nice -- you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year.\\nBut I expect, over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic -- you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's for me it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. You know, we could target, you know, 50, 75. You know, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want.\\nBut, you know, that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to do -- to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. So, I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. So, our big opportunity here is gross margin, and, you know, we're all over it.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches.\\nSo, we'd love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the U.S. EP business as we see some PFA launches this year? Thanks for taking the questions.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Well, I think we've showed a pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition. It's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story.\\nU.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP.\\nBut the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than more than offset that. So, it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So, you know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think, is at the core.\\nYou know, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is, you know, the flexible tip combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's, you know, outcomes for the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world. And then, on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers.\\nAnd, yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So, I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth. As we look to, you know, more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S., listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology.\\nI think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake in usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first -- at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment. And then, from there, then kind of moving past that.\\nSo, you know, right now, I think -- I guess that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that, you know, it will follow a similar pattern. And then, the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground, you know, with the technology.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThank you, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, maybe I could ask on Libre. You know, this is the most successful medical device.\\nAt the conference just a few weeks ago, in San Fran, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward and targets. You know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in '24 and beyond. And one question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data, it's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales, or at least prescriptions are flattening out yet the sales keep growing.\\nHow do we think about the discrepancy there? And how big is the Medicare DME business and, you know, the growth we're getting there from basal? Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Strong growth in Q4, under 1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%.\\nAnd I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But, you know, being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\\nYou know, the growth is going to come from, I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, I mean, a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, OK, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us, but -- and I also think it's multiyear.\\nSo, I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely, you know, two plus-years easily. And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you reference IQVIA, Ravi.\\nSeven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. So, it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where, you know, that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution in growth.\\nI think right now, in the U.S, most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private commercial. Medicare represents about a third of the market. So, I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the build the awareness, you know, build the traveling experience with primary care.\\nAnd that's what we're doing, that's what we have been doing quite frankly for some time. So, it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. And like I said, you know, easily two-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have Robbie, is, you know, looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access, which is that of, you know, pump connectivity, I think this represents a great opportunity for us.\\nIf you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You've got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year. And that patient segment has -- you know, we haven't been able to target it. But now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us.\\nYou know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? Recently, there was an independent third-party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head-to-head study that was published a few weeks ago showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's marred. So, I look at that and I say, OK, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the, you know, best solution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment.\\nSo, I look at the basal, I look at the pump. It's probably good drivers for us, you know, in '24, '25. But, you know, we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. To your question on IQVIA, you know, I think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market.\\nSo, you know, the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So, maybe that's what you're seeing.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate the thoughts.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since this story seems to be very much about wine growth, I haven't heard you reference the Fab 5, one of my favorite analogies in a long time.\\nSo, just wanted to -- and maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab 5 and where, you know, how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth, for 2024? Thanks so much.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products. And we didn't think about calling them that because there was going to be a flash in the pan for, you know, one or two years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company, you know, over the next few years.\\nAnd, you know, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth, and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about, you know, about a point of growth, total Abbott, you know, contribution. So, they're definitely stepping up. And I'd say some of them, I would call market-creating opportunities.\\nTricuspid, I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, you know, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, you know, generating referral pathways. You know, we know how to do this. And we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, you know, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to, you know, market expansion development and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion.\\nAnd, you know, these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments, you know, that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVI space, AVEIR in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that, you know, we're coming in and will have different value propositions. I think AVEIR's got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market.\\nAnd the value proposition for AVEIR, I think, is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implant or to the patient. So, I expect a lot from AVEIR in terms of growth. I expect a lot from, you know, Navitor. And, you know, we're going to be expanding, so we'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan.\\nAnd so, we're investing in those areas. And, yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it, and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year, and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company.\\nSo, you know, that being said, I will say, you know, those are great products, and they take a lot of focus. But we still have -- you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users, this year also. You know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution.\\nWe put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars, in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre. We're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So, yeah, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions.\\nBut there's a lot in the chamber here. And I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nThank you. Very thorough. Thank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year, or nice end to last year, too. So, here's a question I have. In nutrition, you've done a great job of, sounds like, returning to normalcy.\\nI'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track, or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single-digit segment growth category. Thanks.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Yeah, I think kudos to the team here. We set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year, to get to market leadership. In our October call, we had already confirmed that.\\nAnd I'd say over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the No. 2. Yeah, I mean, I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, you know, given the strength of the portfolio of the team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share.\\nYou know, I don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio. So, I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have pre-pandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can, you know, be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down.\\nAnd I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position, with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on healthcare and on nutrition. So, I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher-end 6% range going forward. But I think, right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial-year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range and then as we move into next year, you know, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the adult segment and what is that going to do for us.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Robert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M&A.\\nLooking at the balance sheet, phenomenal position. You at least have a minimum of 20 billion of firepower. Abbott hasn't done any large deals in the last few years. So, my question is, how do you see the opportunity for larger-size deals? What is Abbott's appetite for a larger size, more meaningful transaction?\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet, and it provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So, that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top-line gaps that might be there.\\nSo, that allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then, like you said, you've done the math. We've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good.\\nYou know, profitability matters. You know, earnings matter. And, you know, when you get into these larger-size deals, you know, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top-line play. I think they're harder nowadays.\\nYou know, you look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together, you know, spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought, you know, this business would, you know, would impact the company. So, I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital.\\nAnd -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top-line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to fill a top-line gap.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOperator, we'll take one more question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our last question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some of the companies are kind of calling out above-normal growth.\\nSo, curious, Robert, if you look at your med device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated, you know, catch-ups still coming through? Or do you think this is kind of more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious in some of your thoughts on the overall market.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, I don't think that that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio, I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So, I think there was some disruption, we've talked about it, in some parts of -- some procedures that require a little bit more pre-op planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean, I think those -- that, combined with the labor shortages that occurred, you know, 2022, I think that that that probably slowed a few of them down. But I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that.\\nI just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see, you know, procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in, you know, CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, too, so -- we've seen that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis. A lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our core lab business is actually in the hospital. So, we also get to see that, too.\\nAnd, you know, I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So, we try and triangulate this. I just see this as, you know, procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients, I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve.\\nSome are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and, you know, market positions, etc. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nOK. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023 in many ways. It sort of represented this transition year regarding, you know, the coming down of COVID.\\nI think we did a really good job at managing, you know, the scale-up and the scale-down. A lot of healthcare companies actually participated in trying to solve, you know, the COVID problem. And I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now a transition from being driven by COVID testing to, once again, being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company.\\nWe deliver double-digit organic sales growth on every base business on every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline, we talked a bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024.\\nAnd as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January, so we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOK. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m.\\nCentral Time today on Abbott investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\\nOperator\\nThank you.

(NASDAQ:ALPN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 23, 2023\\n\\nOperator: Welcome to the Alpine Immune Sciences Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Temre Johnson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alpine. Ms. Johnson, I'll now turn the call over to you.\\n\\nTemre Johnson: Thank you, Carrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Dr. Mitchell Gold, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Stanford Peng, President and Head of Research and Development; and Paul Rickey, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mitch, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and involve risk and uncertainties as a result and the timing of events, potential publication of clinical data and expectations regarding the sufficiency of cash and investment could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risk and uncertainties. You may refer to the most recent SEC filings regarding risk factors associated with these statements. Mitch, please go ahead.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you, Temre. Alpine is off to a strong start in 2023 driven by progress in the development of povetacicept, a potentially best-in-class dual inhibitor of BAFF and APRIL cytokines with a convenient once every four weeks simultaneous dosing regimen that we believe has the potential manifestations with erythematosus, autoimmune inflammatory diseases. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved a significant milestone for Povetacicept with the initiation of the RUBY-3 basket study, a first patient-based study for the program, it will study Povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis indications including IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and primary membranous nephropathy. Although still early in development, investigator enthusiasm for the program, and interest in participating in the RUBY-3 study is highly encouraged.\\n\\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\\n\\nIn addition to RUBY-3, we are planning to initiate the the RUBY-4 basket study an autoimmune autoimmune cytopenias in the second quarter of 2023. This includes the autoimmune thrombocytopenia, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinin disease. We expect to share initial data from both the RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 basket studies by the end of this year. We see broad development potential for Povetacicept in multiple indications beyond the basket studies, including our RUBY-2 study systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as neurologic, dermatologic and other rheumatic disease indications. We recently signed a collaboration with Truveta to help accelerate the broad development of Povetacicept across these multiple indications. But then increasingly competitive and sometimes challenging clinical trial Truveta gives us access to its 28th partner members, who provide 16% of patient care in the United States.\\n\\nIn addition to our own efforts, we will leverage Truveta's platform and analytics capabilities to more quickly identify and recruit study participants for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 with the potential to benefit most Povetacicept. We will evoke Povetacicept has the potential to be a pipeline and project with a strong balance sheet and promising preclinical and Phase 1 healthy volunteer data, we are rapidly moving forward with a robust development plan for Povetacicept. And now I will turn over the call over to Stanford to review our progress, provide updates on our broad plans for POVI in more detail. Stanford? Thank you, Mitch. As a reminder, Povetacicept is an Fc fusion of a variant TACI domain, engineered to inhibit more potently the April and BAFF cytokines with wild-type TACI IV fusion proteins.\\n\\nThe clinical relevance of these cytokines continues to grow in multiple autoimmune diseases with proof-of-concept and/or encouraging clinical data is \\u0080\\u0093 in diseases such as systemic lupus, lupus nephritis, IgA, nephropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and Myasthenia gravis. In preclinical studies, Povetacicept has superior to wild-type wild-type TACI IV comparators, as well as inhibitors of only April and BAFF demonstrates potent activity in multiple disease relevant animal health. At Phase 1 human study in adult healthy volunteers, Povetacicept has been well tolerated. It has demonstrated excellent PK and PD, including dose-related reductions in circulating antibody-secreting cells, and serum in globulins as well as the IgA nephropathy relevant biomarker, galactose-deficient IgA1.\\n\\nAgain initial multi dose experiences in each population we are initially focusing on two basket studies. The first is RUBY-3, an open-label basket study in autoimmune glomerulonephritides. This study has just recently begun enrolling. Second, we shortly follow with RUBY-4, an open-label basket study in autoimmune cytopenias. The initial data from these studies we anticipate the ability next year to begin multiple Phase 2 studies including one in systemic lupus erythematosus known as RUBY-2. Additional studies in other disease areas are of great interest, including nephrology or hematology, urology, dermatology, as well as rheumatology besides lupus. Some of these we envision could proceed via an accelerated approval pathway. In summary, Povetacicept can potently target both the April and BAFF cytokines in a unique highly differentiated way.\\n\\nstudy that has broad development potential. We look forward to sharing additional data as the program progresses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul Rickey.\\n\\nPaul Rickey: Thank you, Stanford. I will now provide an overview of our financials for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized under our collaboration programs for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $2.8 million, compared to $4.5 million in 2021. The decrease primarily related to lower revenue recognized under our collaboration with AbbVie, partially offset by revenue recognized in the services performed in connection with our collaboration with Horizon, which was executed late in 2021. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31st 2022, were $18.8 million, compared to $15.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related due to increased head count to support our ongoing and planned clinical development programs.\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter ended December, 31st 2022 we're $4.4 million, compared to $4.5 million for 2021. The company reported net losses of $18.9 million and $15.2 million for the fourth quarter ended 20 22 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31st 2022, Alpine's cash and investments totaled $273.4 million, which we anticipate should be sufficient on our planned operation through 2025. I will now hand the call back to Mitch.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Paul. As Stanford highlighted, we are highly encouraged by the progress of Povetacicept, a milestone that we believe is the only truly potent dual /APRIL/BAFF inhibitor. As a result, we believe in the broad potential for the program may become an important immune disease-modifying therapy, present multiple be some mediated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In closing, we believe we have laid a strong foundation to walk to the next phase of Alpine as we progress throughout the course of this year and into next year. Operator, now open the phone for questions.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And we\\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Mike Ulz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on getting the RUBY-3 study going here. Maybe just a question in terms of both basket studies and maybe you can comment on how you\\u2019re currently thinking about dosing. And if there\\u2019s any additional dosing work you plan to do before getting into the indication specific cohorts in the basket studies. And I guess, part of why I\\u2019m asking I looked on clinicaltrials.gov and I noticed some differences in the dosing that you\\u2019re using for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yes. Maybe I\\u2019ll the first part of that Mike. Thanks for the question and I\\u2019ll ask Stanford to walk you. So just as a reminder, RUBY-3 has two different dose escalations that will be going through both an 80 milligram cohort, and a 240 milligram cohort. And RUBY-4 will be going directly into the 240 milligram dosing group. So there will be no 80 milligram cohort in that group.\\n\\nStanford Peng : That\\u2019s correct. And so, there\\u2019s no, there\\u2019s no pre-indication, sort of phase of the study will be going directly into all three diseases in both trials at the doses that Mitch mentioned.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Got it. That\\u2019s helpful and maybe just one more question from me. I noticed in the press release. For RUBY-2 you plan to sort of start that study in mid 2024 and you make a comment on some \\u2013 based on some enabling data from RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 studies. Maybe you can just clarify what you\\u2019re hoping to learn from those studies that will enable you to start RUBY-2?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Primarily multi-dose data, as you know the phase one study we ran into those pending dose studies. In addition, it will give us greater confidence in to dose selection for the Phase 2 let\\u2019s say.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Good. Got it. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Mike.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Tara Bancroft with Cowen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nTara Bancroft : Hi guys. And thanks for taking the question. So, I\\u2019m wondering what do you expect the rate of enrollment to be in the basket studies now, especially given the Truveta collaboration? And when do you think that you might reach full enrollment? Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Well, we\\u2019ll update it. Enrolling in general has been a challenging in a clinical trial environment to enroll patients. That being said, I\\u2019m pretty pleased with the way RUBY-3 has started. We are getting a lot of investigator interest and a lot of patient interest and I think you saw that in our comments in the press release today. So that in and of itself is encouraging. But I would say it\\u2019s purely on start of that trial but that trial continues we expect it to enroll fairly rapidly. The Truveta collaboration, I\\u2019ll talk a little bit about, Tara I appreciate you bringing that up. You know, I think we welcome to enroll the trials in a very traditional way we work with \\u2013 and we engage investigators in a really active way to identify patients to bring up in the trials.\\n\\nI think one of the things as an industry that we\\u2019ve done fairly poorly is using some of the new electronic medical record systems, and work organization across multiple centers to identify them quickly and then include patients in the clinical trials. Honestly, Truveta is a Seattle-based company. We know them well and work with them to kind of enable their member their member partners io identify patients that are relevant for RUBY-3 and we look forward to enroll them in our clinical trials.\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Thomas Smith with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Brian Conley on for Tom. I believe you just responded to a question about Truveta, but just curious if there are any other gating factors or any other obstacles or challenging factors you\\u2019re encountering as you\\u2019re progressing the basket trials. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah. Thanks Brian. No, I think the reason we put Truveta in place was to be proactive at the start of the study. These are things that you want to be in front of. I would say our traditional efforts are looking at let us exceed the trial and get started in terms of law I think because awareness on the targets and strong awareness in the space. And we have a great group of investigators that we have brought in. The reason we brought Truveta onboard is we want to ask \\u2013 add it on probably one of the number one, do it at the beginning of the trial. And two, as we push into the Phase 2 study next year that\\u2019s clearly resulted in accelerated approval. We wanted the collaboration between us and Truveta to be kind of fully integrated, so we can leverage it as we move into these studies.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Mark Breidenbach with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a quick couple from me. First on the Truveta collaboration. Have you any thoughts on what they\\u2019re getting in return for helping optimize enrollment of RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: I am sorry. I lost you one second. Can you say that one more time?\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Yeah, sorry. What\\u2019s Truveta getting in return for helping you guys enroll in RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Let me take in traditional services agreement. So there\\u2019s kind of a baseline fee that we pay them and then as they enroll a certain number of patients, they have certain objectives that they need to meet to be able to generate service fees and as a result of that. So, it\\u2019s not any direct measures on services security.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. And with regard to the upcoming presentation at WCN from RUBY-1, is there anything in that presentation that we haven\\u2019t already seen? What\\u2019s kind of going to be the focus of that upcoming presentation next week?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Our main goal is to \\u2013 reader awareness we didn\\u2019t present there last year that I am sure you\\u2019re aware, but make sure that, just build awareness about the target and the molecule with that audience, as it will be updated Phase 1 data with regard to additional follow-up is some of the subjects. Although the general conclusions about change that you can tell us some of our preceding comments.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. Maybe one last one for me. I know, you mention the 80 mg and 240 mg dosing cohorts in RUBY-3. Can you just comment on the dosing schedules and how those compare to, let\\u2019s say, if we use povetacicept as the closest equivalent or competing drug, how will the dosing schedules compare between your drug and RemeGen\\u2019s? Thank you.\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, our trials both are doing things in a two four week dose regimen and as at all doses, for both doses being tested. As far as we are aware, RemeGen is 160 milligrams of Sub-Q weekly and it appears to be the doses for all their pivotal trials. So, when the person where Q4 versus Q1 week. As you know, we start to talk about best-in-class potential for POVI where the key things that differentiate us is, one that we were potent, two that we have a much more convenient dosing schedule and the fact that we cover both cytokines more completely than either of the wild-type TACI \\u0080\\u0093 in three broad development plan going forward.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our last question from the line of with Joe Pantginis with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks taking the question. Wanted to get a little more color if you can regarding the end-of-year initial data from both RUBY- 3 and RUBY-4. Is this going to be essentially, early response type of data for each type of indication or can we get more than that initially with regard to say any translational or PD data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, we\\u2019ll be focusing quite a bit on both traditional endpoints, as well as biomarker-related data. So, PD endpoints, including immunoglobulintarget, cytokine targets, as well as biomarkers or things like a Gd-IgA1 in IG nephropathy as each of these indications has their respective antibody that we will be looking at. So we\\u2019ll be looking all of that and look forward to be able to report that early this year.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : That\\u2019s great. And do you think you could just remind, I mean, since it\\u2019s a basket concept, how many per indication you\\u2019re looking for and how many you think that might deliver for the initial data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: It\\u2019s a basket trial. We\\u2019ll see harmonization that I can say that we\\u2019re getting interest. The recent RUBY-3 so far we are getting interest in across all the different subtypes, lupus nephritis and primary membranous nephropathy. Exactly how that mix is going to shake out surely to say right now, but early on we\\u2019re pretty pleased with the mix of interest that\\u2019s coming into the trial.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Sure, got it. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: There are no for the questions, Dr. Gold. I\\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you operator. Thank you all for taking part in today\\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you in upcoming investor and medical meetings and providing updates in the months ahead. Thank you and have a great afternoon.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our call today. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Operator\\nWelcome to the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, vice president of investor relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.\\nIn addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\\nSteve Frank -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our chief executive officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S.\\nGAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13th, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin. \\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S.\\nand 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises.\\nWe don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the No. 1 selling OA pain product in Europe.\\nAt Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth.\\nSimilarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain maps. Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism.\\nWe remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.\\nAs we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance.\\nOur dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market.\\nOur focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition.\\nI want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders.\\nWhile there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you. Now let me hand it over to Wetteny.\\nWetteny?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S.\\nand international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animals was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction among both vets and pet owners.\\nOur key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals.\\nAdjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while international segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%.\\nWe saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.\\nSimparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S.\\nand international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from Draxxin and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims.\\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal pre price buy-in at the end of last year.\\nIn the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.\\nMoving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S.\\nsales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S.\\nsales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S.\\nWe have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%.\\nGrowth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges and in advance of a than expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and a significant advantage of being first to market. Key dermatology products sales in the U.S.\\nwere $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. Simparica franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our U.S.\\ncompanion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.\\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\\nGrowth in our OA pain products was equally driven by full focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis.\\nWe continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness.\\nThis growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio.\\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition-related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation.\\nR&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.\\nAdjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders.\\nFor the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024.\\nPlease note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points.\\nwith significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume.\\nWe expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally.\\nOur current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio.\\nFor livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth.\\nFor companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio.\\nWe expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination animal parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.\\nAdjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix.\\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million.\\nThis is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market.\\nand growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.\\nTo summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future.\\nAs we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. So can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the U.S. and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter to quarter.\\nAnd then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp-up of Librela that weigh on margins. But can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher-margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer-term margin leverage. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yeah. We were very pleased with how we did with Librela in this first full quarter of launch in Q4.\\nAs you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we -- given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected in line with our expectations. So that makes us really confident as we go into the year.\\nwe're looking at what -- your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clicks. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the No.\\n1 selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the U.S. as well. So we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the U.S.\\nSo I'll let Wetteny take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed, there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond, we do have Librela in 2023, as we've said at Investor Day, if you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand. They started being dilutive to the overall company average, for example, in 2023. As we go through 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below whether you would consider our innovative companion animal products.\\nAnd as we exit '24 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So overall, beyond '24, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect. But I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So that mix will continue to be favorable for us.\\nAnd as we get into the higher levels of production from monoclonal antibodies, they are also accretive to overall margins. And we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023.\\nAnd as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we're positioned to continue to expand.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So it looks like you're guiding back in the analogue math you're guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024.\\nBut you also did finish '23 lower than we would have expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You call out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation.\\nAny way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in '23? And then maybe what some of those onetime headwinds would have as an impact to 2024. Just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela. I don't believe you actually quantified the target.\\nSo I want to -- just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point. is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable. And especially that's for U.S., but then on the OUS side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of the Europe and it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So any color on what's going on internationally? Thanks.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure, Mike. Let me take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So take a look at margins. Indeed, in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion in margins.\\nKeep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact and about 80 of that is from FX. So you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly, a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our lifestyle team in Utah, and look, they've had a great year, and we expect lifestyle continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end.\\nSo that created a little bit of a mix. Yes, and as well as Librela outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit dilutive. So when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting '23. Most of the impact here is coming from FX about 80 basis points.\\nThe other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended FX is that has the impact on our on our finish here. If you take a look at FX, which is clearly nonoperational and you factor nonrecurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition. Those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here.\\nOf course, we don't forecast FX. So what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are. at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024.\\nAnd so that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past, and I will sit here and guess what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024, and that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes. For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue. Price is a pretty significant factor.\\nWe continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of 2 to 3 points. And perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And the Librela with the U.S. launch, clearly is going to be a significant factor.\\nCertainly, $44 million in the quarter and Q4 was, again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So you can model that out in terms of what that would translate to. We're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far as we discussed already.\\nIn international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets in addition to the U.S.\\n$44 million. So I think what we have to really take into account here is as we've been launching in markets. In Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out, you just focus on those markets that we've already launched.\\nWe're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters about give or take. So we're going to be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat.\\nOperator\\nWe'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\\nJon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nOK. Thanks guys. Good morning. Wendy, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of the easier 1Q '23 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half.\\nSo just -- how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And in the guidance for the full year, maybe GM, we're a little bit below what we were thinking. But SG&A expense despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So maybe you can just talk through those items why we're only seeing seems like low to mid-single-digit SG&A growth year over year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX? And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the U.S.\\n4Q '23 to 1Q '24 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks guys.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, John. If you look in Q1, certainly if you look at companion animal in the U.S., this is an easier comp.\\nWe had destocking in the first quarter last year. clearly something we look to see as an easier comp we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so I think if you look to balance complete the balance, but it's lifestyle growth both in the U.S.\\nas well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So that becomes a heavier I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions -- weather conditions in Australia, etc., are having an impact there. So I think if you balance those out and last point I'll make is, Librela, we are clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year.\\nSo Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Novella accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relative to speaking in Q1. So when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now we did make references to FX.\\nSo from a reported basis, that, again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple of weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. When FX de facto, hopefully, what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with the momentum as we exited Q4 and Q1, again, looking at U.S.\\ncompanion animal, but that's how I think about it. Now is Q1 is going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective, I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stock in that $12 million to $15 million. So even if you had a flat that means you grow by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here.\\nRight now, what I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDave Westenberg -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. So last year, we saw some discounting in front of the next gaurd combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of Elanco's Quattro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just a second one on just the DTC efforts on Librela.\\nI don't think there is DC allowed in Europe. But can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and maybe how that messaging can come out? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year, overall Trio grew 9%.\\nSo we're very pleased with that as we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in Trio for the year. So this obviously underscores everything and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So we do anticipate, obviously, a competitor entering I'm not exactly sure what -- how Elanco's Quattro will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product.\\nThey do mention taper, but you get tapeworm from fleas then we actually control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So we abused to having good competitors, obviously, with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional.\\nBut I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone entree is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market.\\nWhat we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, etc. So as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on what have we learned from Librela in Europe, so we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness.\\nI think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to encouraging them that there is a new product and then they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplift from direct-to-consumer advertising even when it's not branded. So I don't know what you want to add into that?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio been performing really well for us in the face of drug competition in the U.S. going to be more pleased. And to be gaining patient share in the face of competition.\\nI think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So look, there'll be some initial heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in with factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't hold in on specific reaction and so on, but we're very confident in our ability to grow continued growth franchise, and we're saying we're going to see mid- to single-digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid- to high single-digit growth for the franchise overall.\\nI guess, specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China. Could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that, that growth is obviously understated given the price -- if you're looking at the pre priced buy-in that we saw in late 2022.\\nAs we look at our guidance for mid- to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the U.S. You have pruritus.\\nThere is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market, seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products.\\nOur products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vest. And we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, build a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet and our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in Apoquel chewable and moving them to chewable pet owners really prefer.\\nWe've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the U.S. And we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term on the long-acting. So we are going to defend this franchise.\\nWe're confident in this franchise, our guidance of mid- to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the U.S. and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring life cycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. And one point on derm of course, we have a mid- to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance. of course, across a broad range of expectation there, there's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, etc., will play into that and the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow.\\nOur franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting to ignore nor improve at least through the first half of our year, and we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, little bit less so into the first half of '24, but still a headwind into the first half of '24.\\nYou continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices are remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So all those factors, of course, long term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade. But in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth.\\nIn fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBalaji Prasad -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. A couple. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points return revenue and 150 basis points on EPS is to be going from here.\\nWhy is FX severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean my general understanding is with $4 billion of -- $4-plus billion of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis received on Librela number. I wanted to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela's as promotion with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points, and what is the current status now with regard to your communication with FDA.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure Balaji, so I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I see you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification, would -- what you're talking about is a request for clarification on our promotional materials.\\nWe just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean this isn't uncommon. So I don't -- that was easily resolved last year, that was a minor issue.\\nBut Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. On currency dynamics. And again, we don't forecast FX. So we tend to report out what we see the impact is.\\nAnd the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina, if you follow Argentina, there have been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August. And there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those clearly is impact on top line that we've talked about. But there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time.\\nSo by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down to bottom line. So combinations volume. Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced in their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they value. That's what you're seeing play out.\\nBut really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\\nBrandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre priced buying in the quarter. Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that, maybe higher level.\\nIs there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us, you're still spending a lot of money in R&D and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre priced buying in our -- as we exit the year given where what our price increases are going to be I would say, compared to the prior year where there was higher than average reprice buying as in 2022 into 2023, which had the impact on '24, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of reprice buying exiting 2023. And that gave us really First, the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into but also, I would say, our quarter position walking into January 2024, we're certainly in a better position than, say, the prior year.\\nSo we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. And the question with regards to R&D. Obviously, we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health.\\nAnd if you look at the -- how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium and long term. In Animal Health, different than human health, that really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like life cycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apical Chewable, which will significantly support our key brands.\\nWe're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one- to three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long-acting. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term and really important new franchises as well, such as renal, chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes, there's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics as well as behind our livestock business.\\nlooking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nChris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth.\\nI know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. I'm just trying to get more color on what is the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still that capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex U.S.\\nFrom your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm showing a sense of like we're in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex U.S. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered as we've spoken about many times before to that business. I mean obviously, they're not inconsequential our view of 0% to 1% is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time.\\nSo I think we're really saying it's back to normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the U.S. But I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it.\\nBut we really sort of view the year as you look into the year for although we saw flat vet visits, we spot revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously, overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time. with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, etc. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the U.S., I think we're still early innings.\\nAnd really where I think we see the growth is right now, that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs. I mean, I think, obviously, at least somewhere -- I mean in my 50s, I will say, my hip hurts right now. But everyone doesn't know that it's around me.\\nAnd so the reality is osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're living and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think, is critical. So I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first-line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think we more -- we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise.\\nSo we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Stephen Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nUnknown speaker\\nThis is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First, on Librela. To what degree are U.S.\\ndebt capacity constraints, the headwind to longer-term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home administrative formulation? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So that capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on. But I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech.\\nAnd I think the industry is really focused, and we've been partnering with corporates the ABM with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far, globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a U.S. issue, it's global.\\nSo far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second question is with regard to home delivery. You want to take that one?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock and innovation, not only in our OA pain maps, but across our portfolio, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer-acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela will be the direction that will help with this, even though as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the maps.\\nI think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, etc. And that varies a bit, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\nNavann Ty -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions I have two ones on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela.\\nWith continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&As in addition to the current testing campaign -- and just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025. And then on Trio, can you help us explain the switches from to Mexico plus? Are they mostly from BI's homes like large rather than from Simparica Trio and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments, and we already started because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing the DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about year and a half or so ago. So we're able to leverage those investments, and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product.\\nThe gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023 and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage above. So 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it's below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see at those innovative levels, which is above -- well above the company. average.\\nSo hopefully, that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth, grew 17% in the U.S. in and we continue to gain patient share, which means, again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe effication has been in the market. for almost four years now.\\nSo we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know if Kristin, you want to add.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nWe're doing quite well of topics U.S. specifically with regards to puppies. I mean puppies are on the Trio label. So I just want to emphasize that.\\nI know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So I mean, really, if you're looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual agent customers to a triple combination and certainly a movement to more people from topical to oral. So there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies to answer that other part of your question.\\nOperator\\nThere seem to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nGreat. Thank you all so much for the questions. And honestly, your continued interest in Zoetis. I want to undergo that the enduring strength of the human animal bond for pet owners expectations of human-quality healthcare for pets and the need for safe and secure food supply all underscore that animal health industry is essential and very durable.\\nWe remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just a line and to grow operational revenue by mid- to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio, and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises. The animal health industry is resilient even in times of uncertainty, and we are poised to navigate these challenges because our portfolio diversity, our commitment to exceptional customer experience, operational excellence, and agility, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in future calls.\\nThanks a must for joining us today, guys. Have a great day.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\n\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nGood morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.\\nWith the exception of any participant's questions asked, during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, vice president, investor relations.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, chairman and chief executive officer; Bob Funck, executive vice president for finance; and Phil Boudreau, senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results, as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time to position the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier, given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing experienced a slowdown to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world placed a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffered during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient.\\nIt was also during this time that we created a multibillion dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders. But we knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead.\\nWe pulled forward our accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale-down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company. Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions.\\nAnd this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution.\\nAnd in medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals, along with several new opportunities, to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year.\\nSales, excluding COVID testing, grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11%, higher than our original guidance of high single-digit growth. Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic. Turning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecasted sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business. I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S.\\nwas driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader. International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\\nTurning to established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results. Moving to diagnostics, growth in rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing.\\nThe flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering. Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations.\\nThe system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales, led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis.\\nIn heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. So, in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year.\\nWe outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil?\\nPhil Boudreau -- Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which as expected reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for 2024, today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024.\\nFor the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice end to the year here. So, Robert, you know, pre-COVID Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically. As you mentioned, you're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base.\\nWhat has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions and I'll leave it there for my one question. Thank you.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and, quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business, I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these four business, and their underlying attractiveness still is, you know, is very sustainable. So, strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these four segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in.\\nSo, I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging, you know, geographies and different markets.\\nAnd they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think you know, even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their margin profile by 300 basis points. So, a pretty strong position, strong team. And then, you know, we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which, historically, hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets.\\nIt's probably been more of a developed market place. So, I think that's going to, you know, provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think, did an incredible job here, as we said at the beginning of last year, regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product.\\nBut even adult -- our adult business. Our adult business has increased $1 billion, you know, since pre-pandemic. And it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion growing high single digits.\\nThere's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that, you know, command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also. Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well.\\nWe've talked about, you know, our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio and, quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. And our rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to, you know, put through those instruments so -- and then, medical devices, you know, historically, was in that high single digit growth.\\nI think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-sized business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like [Inaudible] or EP, structural heart, ADC, I mean those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices, our CRM and vascular businesses that were, you know, showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4. With CRM, I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology.\\nOn vascular, it's been a combination of adding and organically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segment. So, I think that's really, you know, in a nutshell, across all these very four attractive segments, we've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you know, you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth. And they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten, you know, more growth opportunities within.\\nSo, I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about, you know, accelerating sales but, you know, not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. You know, our core business grew EPS last year, you know, 40-plus percent.\\nWe're forecasting double-digit earnings-per-share growth, you know, this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So, I'd say, yeah, you know, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics.\\nBut, you know, we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have. On the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range. But it's only January, so I think this is a good starting point.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nSuper helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and I echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. I was hoping to just follow up on your comments, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. You know, Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally.\\nBut was hoping to just -- thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business and that 30 to 50 basis point range, was hoping you just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in '24 and into the outyears? Thanks for taking the question.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre-pandemic level.\\nAnd I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we managed, you know, very well strategically the spending piece of it. You know, we accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then, we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was, you know, was growing pretty significantly here. So, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line.\\nAnd that is, you know, I think about our big five activities this year in the company. You know, and we can do all five of them at the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. You know, we're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, you know, roughly around 75 basis points.\\nAnd, you know, there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So, you know, every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis, they all get reported out.\\nSo, there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs. Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So, you know, whether it's commodity costs, you know, freight and distribution, you know, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now, and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, you know, turning into tailwinds. So, that helps.\\nAnd then, the other part here is just, you know, I'd say portfolio mix. So, as some of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher-margin businesses. And, you know, they provide that, you know, that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So, I think this provides a nice -- you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year.\\nBut I expect, over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic -- you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's for me it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. You know, we could target, you know, 50, 75. You know, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want.\\nBut, you know, that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to do -- to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. So, I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. So, our big opportunity here is gross margin, and, you know, we're all over it.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches.\\nSo, we'd love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the U.S. EP business as we see some PFA launches this year? Thanks for taking the questions.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Well, I think we've showed a pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition. It's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story.\\nU.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP.\\nBut the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than more than offset that. So, it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So, you know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think, is at the core.\\nYou know, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is, you know, the flexible tip combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's, you know, outcomes for the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world. And then, on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers.\\nAnd, yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So, I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth. As we look to, you know, more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S., listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology.\\nI think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake in usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first -- at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment. And then, from there, then kind of moving past that.\\nSo, you know, right now, I think -- I guess that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that, you know, it will follow a similar pattern. And then, the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground, you know, with the technology.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThank you, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, maybe I could ask on Libre. You know, this is the most successful medical device.\\nAt the conference just a few weeks ago, in San Fran, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward and targets. You know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in '24 and beyond. And one question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data, it's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales, or at least prescriptions are flattening out yet the sales keep growing.\\nHow do we think about the discrepancy there? And how big is the Medicare DME business and, you know, the growth we're getting there from basal? Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Strong growth in Q4, under 1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%.\\nAnd I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But, you know, being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\\nYou know, the growth is going to come from, I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, I mean, a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, OK, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us, but -- and I also think it's multiyear.\\nSo, I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely, you know, two plus-years easily. And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you reference IQVIA, Ravi.\\nSeven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. So, it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where, you know, that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution in growth.\\nI think right now, in the U.S, most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private commercial. Medicare represents about a third of the market. So, I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the build the awareness, you know, build the traveling experience with primary care.\\nAnd that's what we're doing, that's what we have been doing quite frankly for some time. So, it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. And like I said, you know, easily two-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have Robbie, is, you know, looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access, which is that of, you know, pump connectivity, I think this represents a great opportunity for us.\\nIf you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You've got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year. And that patient segment has -- you know, we haven't been able to target it. But now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us.\\nYou know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? Recently, there was an independent third-party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head-to-head study that was published a few weeks ago showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's marred. So, I look at that and I say, OK, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the, you know, best solution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment.\\nSo, I look at the basal, I look at the pump. It's probably good drivers for us, you know, in '24, '25. But, you know, we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. To your question on IQVIA, you know, I think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market.\\nSo, you know, the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So, maybe that's what you're seeing.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate the thoughts.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since this story seems to be very much about wine growth, I haven't heard you reference the Fab 5, one of my favorite analogies in a long time.\\nSo, just wanted to -- and maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab 5 and where, you know, how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth, for 2024? Thanks so much.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products. And we didn't think about calling them that because there was going to be a flash in the pan for, you know, one or two years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company, you know, over the next few years.\\nAnd, you know, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth, and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about, you know, about a point of growth, total Abbott, you know, contribution. So, they're definitely stepping up. And I'd say some of them, I would call market-creating opportunities.\\nTricuspid, I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, you know, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, you know, generating referral pathways. You know, we know how to do this. And we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, you know, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to, you know, market expansion development and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion.\\nAnd, you know, these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments, you know, that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVI space, AVEIR in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that, you know, we're coming in and will have different value propositions. I think AVEIR's got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market.\\nAnd the value proposition for AVEIR, I think, is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implant or to the patient. So, I expect a lot from AVEIR in terms of growth. I expect a lot from, you know, Navitor. And, you know, we're going to be expanding, so we'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan.\\nAnd so, we're investing in those areas. And, yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it, and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year, and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company.\\nSo, you know, that being said, I will say, you know, those are great products, and they take a lot of focus. But we still have -- you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users, this year also. You know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution.\\nWe put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars, in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre. We're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So, yeah, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions.\\nBut there's a lot in the chamber here. And I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nThank you. Very thorough. Thank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year, or nice end to last year, too. So, here's a question I have. In nutrition, you've done a great job of, sounds like, returning to normalcy.\\nI'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track, or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single-digit segment growth category. Thanks.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Yeah, I think kudos to the team here. We set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year, to get to market leadership. In our October call, we had already confirmed that.\\nAnd I'd say over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the No. 2. Yeah, I mean, I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, you know, given the strength of the portfolio of the team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share.\\nYou know, I don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio. So, I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have pre-pandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can, you know, be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down.\\nAnd I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position, with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on healthcare and on nutrition. So, I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher-end 6% range going forward. But I think, right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial-year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range and then as we move into next year, you know, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the adult segment and what is that going to do for us.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Robert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M&A.\\nLooking at the balance sheet, phenomenal position. You at least have a minimum of 20 billion of firepower. Abbott hasn't done any large deals in the last few years. So, my question is, how do you see the opportunity for larger-size deals? What is Abbott's appetite for a larger size, more meaningful transaction?\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet, and it provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So, that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top-line gaps that might be there.\\nSo, that allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then, like you said, you've done the math. We've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good.\\nYou know, profitability matters. You know, earnings matter. And, you know, when you get into these larger-size deals, you know, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top-line play. I think they're harder nowadays.\\nYou know, you look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together, you know, spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought, you know, this business would, you know, would impact the company. So, I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital.\\nAnd -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top-line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to fill a top-line gap.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOperator, we'll take one more question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our last question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some of the companies are kind of calling out above-normal growth.\\nSo, curious, Robert, if you look at your med device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated, you know, catch-ups still coming through? Or do you think this is kind of more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious in some of your thoughts on the overall market.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, I don't think that that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio, I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So, I think there was some disruption, we've talked about it, in some parts of -- some procedures that require a little bit more pre-op planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean, I think those -- that, combined with the labor shortages that occurred, you know, 2022, I think that that that probably slowed a few of them down. But I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that.\\nI just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see, you know, procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in, you know, CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, too, so -- we've seen that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis. A lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our core lab business is actually in the hospital. So, we also get to see that, too.\\nAnd, you know, I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So, we try and triangulate this. I just see this as, you know, procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients, I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve.\\nSome are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and, you know, market positions, etc. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nOK. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023 in many ways. It sort of represented this transition year regarding, you know, the coming down of COVID.\\nI think we did a really good job at managing, you know, the scale-up and the scale-down. A lot of healthcare companies actually participated in trying to solve, you know, the COVID problem. And I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now a transition from being driven by COVID testing to, once again, being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company.\\nWe deliver double-digit organic sales growth on every base business on every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline, we talked a bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024.\\nAnd as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January, so we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOK. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m.\\nCentral Time today on Abbott investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\\nOperator\\nThank you.

(NASDAQ:ALPN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 23, 2023\\n\\nOperator: Welcome to the Alpine Immune Sciences Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Temre Johnson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alpine. Ms. Johnson, I'll now turn the call over to you.\\n\\nTemre Johnson: Thank you, Carrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Dr. Mitchell Gold, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Stanford Peng, President and Head of Research and Development; and Paul Rickey, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mitch, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and involve risk and uncertainties as a result and the timing of events, potential publication of clinical data and expectations regarding the sufficiency of cash and investment could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risk and uncertainties. You may refer to the most recent SEC filings regarding risk factors associated with these statements. Mitch, please go ahead.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you, Temre. Alpine is off to a strong start in 2023 driven by progress in the development of povetacicept, a potentially best-in-class dual inhibitor of BAFF and APRIL cytokines with a convenient once every four weeks simultaneous dosing regimen that we believe has the potential manifestations with erythematosus, autoimmune inflammatory diseases. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved a significant milestone for Povetacicept with the initiation of the RUBY-3 basket study, a first patient-based study for the program, it will study Povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis indications including IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and primary membranous nephropathy. Although still early in development, investigator enthusiasm for the program, and interest in participating in the RUBY-3 study is highly encouraged.\\n\\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\\n\\nIn addition to RUBY-3, we are planning to initiate the the RUBY-4 basket study an autoimmune autoimmune cytopenias in the second quarter of 2023. This includes the autoimmune thrombocytopenia, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinin disease. We expect to share initial data from both the RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 basket studies by the end of this year. We see broad development potential for Povetacicept in multiple indications beyond the basket studies, including our RUBY-2 study systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as neurologic, dermatologic and other rheumatic disease indications. We recently signed a collaboration with Truveta to help accelerate the broad development of Povetacicept across these multiple indications. But then increasingly competitive and sometimes challenging clinical trial Truveta gives us access to its 28th partner members, who provide 16% of patient care in the United States.\\n\\nIn addition to our own efforts, we will leverage Truveta's platform and analytics capabilities to more quickly identify and recruit study participants for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 with the potential to benefit most Povetacicept. We will evoke Povetacicept has the potential to be a pipeline and project with a strong balance sheet and promising preclinical and Phase 1 healthy volunteer data, we are rapidly moving forward with a robust development plan for Povetacicept. And now I will turn over the call over to Stanford to review our progress, provide updates on our broad plans for POVI in more detail. Stanford? Thank you, Mitch. As a reminder, Povetacicept is an Fc fusion of a variant TACI domain, engineered to inhibit more potently the April and BAFF cytokines with wild-type TACI IV fusion proteins.\\n\\nThe clinical relevance of these cytokines continues to grow in multiple autoimmune diseases with proof-of-concept and/or encouraging clinical data is \\u0080\\u0093 in diseases such as systemic lupus, lupus nephritis, IgA, nephropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and Myasthenia gravis. In preclinical studies, Povetacicept has superior to wild-type wild-type TACI IV comparators, as well as inhibitors of only April and BAFF demonstrates potent activity in multiple disease relevant animal health. At Phase 1 human study in adult healthy volunteers, Povetacicept has been well tolerated. It has demonstrated excellent PK and PD, including dose-related reductions in circulating antibody-secreting cells, and serum in globulins as well as the IgA nephropathy relevant biomarker, galactose-deficient IgA1.\\n\\nAgain initial multi dose experiences in each population we are initially focusing on two basket studies. The first is RUBY-3, an open-label basket study in autoimmune glomerulonephritides. This study has just recently begun enrolling. Second, we shortly follow with RUBY-4, an open-label basket study in autoimmune cytopenias. The initial data from these studies we anticipate the ability next year to begin multiple Phase 2 studies including one in systemic lupus erythematosus known as RUBY-2. Additional studies in other disease areas are of great interest, including nephrology or hematology, urology, dermatology, as well as rheumatology besides lupus. Some of these we envision could proceed via an accelerated approval pathway. In summary, Povetacicept can potently target both the April and BAFF cytokines in a unique highly differentiated way.\\n\\nstudy that has broad development potential. We look forward to sharing additional data as the program progresses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul Rickey.\\n\\nPaul Rickey: Thank you, Stanford. I will now provide an overview of our financials for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized under our collaboration programs for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $2.8 million, compared to $4.5 million in 2021. The decrease primarily related to lower revenue recognized under our collaboration with AbbVie, partially offset by revenue recognized in the services performed in connection with our collaboration with Horizon, which was executed late in 2021. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31st 2022, were $18.8 million, compared to $15.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher personnel-related due to increased head count to support our ongoing and planned clinical development programs.\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter ended December, 31st 2022 we're $4.4 million, compared to $4.5 million for 2021. The company reported net losses of $18.9 million and $15.2 million for the fourth quarter ended 20 22 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31st 2022, Alpine's cash and investments totaled $273.4 million, which we anticipate should be sufficient on our planned operation through 2025. I will now hand the call back to Mitch.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Paul. As Stanford highlighted, we are highly encouraged by the progress of Povetacicept, a milestone that we believe is the only truly potent dual /APRIL/BAFF inhibitor. As a result, we believe in the broad potential for the program may become an important immune disease-modifying therapy, present multiple be some mediated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In closing, we believe we have laid a strong foundation to walk to the next phase of Alpine as we progress throughout the course of this year and into next year. Operator, now open the phone for questions.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And we\\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Mike Ulz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on getting the RUBY-3 study going here. Maybe just a question in terms of both basket studies and maybe you can comment on how you\\u2019re currently thinking about dosing. And if there\\u2019s any additional dosing work you plan to do before getting into the indication specific cohorts in the basket studies. And I guess, part of why I\\u2019m asking I looked on clinicaltrials.gov and I noticed some differences in the dosing that you\\u2019re using for RUBY-3 and RUBY-4. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yes. Maybe I\\u2019ll the first part of that Mike. Thanks for the question and I\\u2019ll ask Stanford to walk you. So just as a reminder, RUBY-3 has two different dose escalations that will be going through both an 80 milligram cohort, and a 240 milligram cohort. And RUBY-4 will be going directly into the 240 milligram dosing group. So there will be no 80 milligram cohort in that group.\\n\\nStanford Peng : That\\u2019s correct. And so, there\\u2019s no, there\\u2019s no pre-indication, sort of phase of the study will be going directly into all three diseases in both trials at the doses that Mitch mentioned.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Got it. That\\u2019s helpful and maybe just one more question from me. I noticed in the press release. For RUBY-2 you plan to sort of start that study in mid 2024 and you make a comment on some \\u2013 based on some enabling data from RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 studies. Maybe you can just clarify what you\\u2019re hoping to learn from those studies that will enable you to start RUBY-2?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Primarily multi-dose data, as you know the phase one study we ran into those pending dose studies. In addition, it will give us greater confidence in to dose selection for the Phase 2 let\\u2019s say.\\n\\nMike Ulz : Good. Got it. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks, Mike.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Tara Bancroft with Cowen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nTara Bancroft : Hi guys. And thanks for taking the question. So, I\\u2019m wondering what do you expect the rate of enrollment to be in the basket studies now, especially given the Truveta collaboration? And when do you think that you might reach full enrollment? Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Well, we\\u2019ll update it. Enrolling in general has been a challenging in a clinical trial environment to enroll patients. That being said, I\\u2019m pretty pleased with the way RUBY-3 has started. We are getting a lot of investigator interest and a lot of patient interest and I think you saw that in our comments in the press release today. So that in and of itself is encouraging. But I would say it\\u2019s purely on start of that trial but that trial continues we expect it to enroll fairly rapidly. The Truveta collaboration, I\\u2019ll talk a little bit about, Tara I appreciate you bringing that up. You know, I think we welcome to enroll the trials in a very traditional way we work with \\u2013 and we engage investigators in a really active way to identify patients to bring up in the trials.\\n\\nI think one of the things as an industry that we\\u2019ve done fairly poorly is using some of the new electronic medical record systems, and work organization across multiple centers to identify them quickly and then include patients in the clinical trials. Honestly, Truveta is a Seattle-based company. We know them well and work with them to kind of enable their member their member partners io identify patients that are relevant for RUBY-3 and we look forward to enroll them in our clinical trials.\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Thomas Smith with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Brian Conley on for Tom. I believe you just responded to a question about Truveta, but just curious if there are any other gating factors or any other obstacles or challenging factors you\\u2019re encountering as you\\u2019re progressing the basket trials. Thanks.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah. Thanks Brian. No, I think the reason we put Truveta in place was to be proactive at the start of the study. These are things that you want to be in front of. I would say our traditional efforts are looking at let us exceed the trial and get started in terms of law I think because awareness on the targets and strong awareness in the space. And we have a great group of investigators that we have brought in. The reason we brought Truveta onboard is we want to ask \\u2013 add it on probably one of the number one, do it at the beginning of the trial. And two, as we push into the Phase 2 study next year that\\u2019s clearly resulted in accelerated approval. We wanted the collaboration between us and Truveta to be kind of fully integrated, so we can leverage it as we move into these studies.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Mark Breidenbach with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a quick couple from me. First on the Truveta collaboration. Have you any thoughts on what they\\u2019re getting in return for helping optimize enrollment of RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: I am sorry. I lost you one second. Can you say that one more time?\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Yeah, sorry. What\\u2019s Truveta getting in return for helping you guys enroll in RUBY-3 and RUBY-4?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Let me take in traditional services agreement. So there\\u2019s kind of a baseline fee that we pay them and then as they enroll a certain number of patients, they have certain objectives that they need to meet to be able to generate service fees and as a result of that. So, it\\u2019s not any direct measures on services security.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. And with regard to the upcoming presentation at WCN from RUBY-1, is there anything in that presentation that we haven\\u2019t already seen? What\\u2019s kind of going to be the focus of that upcoming presentation next week?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Our main goal is to \\u2013 reader awareness we didn\\u2019t present there last year that I am sure you\\u2019re aware, but make sure that, just build awareness about the target and the molecule with that audience, as it will be updated Phase 1 data with regard to additional follow-up is some of the subjects. Although the general conclusions about change that you can tell us some of our preceding comments.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Okay. Got it. Maybe one last one for me. I know, you mention the 80 mg and 240 mg dosing cohorts in RUBY-3. Can you just comment on the dosing schedules and how those compare to, let\\u2019s say, if we use povetacicept as the closest equivalent or competing drug, how will the dosing schedules compare between your drug and RemeGen\\u2019s? Thank you.\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, our trials both are doing things in a two four week dose regimen and as at all doses, for both doses being tested. As far as we are aware, RemeGen is 160 milligrams of Sub-Q weekly and it appears to be the doses for all their pivotal trials. So, when the person where Q4 versus Q1 week. As you know, we start to talk about best-in-class potential for POVI where the key things that differentiate us is, one that we were potent, two that we have a much more convenient dosing schedule and the fact that we cover both cytokines more completely than either of the wild-type TACI \\u0080\\u0093 in three broad development plan going forward.\\n\\nMark Breidenbach: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: And we\\u2019ll take our last question from the line of with Joe Pantginis with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Hey everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks taking the question. Wanted to get a little more color if you can regarding the end-of-year initial data from both RUBY- 3 and RUBY-4. Is this going to be essentially, early response type of data for each type of indication or can we get more than that initially with regard to say any translational or PD data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Yeah, we\\u2019ll be focusing quite a bit on both traditional endpoints, as well as biomarker-related data. So, PD endpoints, including immunoglobulintarget, cytokine targets, as well as biomarkers or things like a Gd-IgA1 in IG nephropathy as each of these indications has their respective antibody that we will be looking at. So we\\u2019ll be looking all of that and look forward to be able to report that early this year.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : That\\u2019s great. And do you think you could just remind, I mean, since it\\u2019s a basket concept, how many per indication you\\u2019re looking for and how many you think that might deliver for the initial data?\\n\\nMitchell Gold: It\\u2019s a basket trial. We\\u2019ll see harmonization that I can say that we\\u2019re getting interest. The recent RUBY-3 so far we are getting interest in across all the different subtypes, lupus nephritis and primary membranous nephropathy. Exactly how that mix is going to shake out surely to say right now, but early on we\\u2019re pretty pleased with the mix of interest that\\u2019s coming into the trial.\\n\\nJoe Pantginis : Sure, got it. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thanks.\\n\\nOperator: There are no for the questions, Dr. Gold. I\\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.\\n\\nMitchell Gold: Thank you operator. Thank you all for taking part in today\\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing many of you in upcoming investor and medical meetings and providing updates in the months ahead. Thank you and have a great afternoon.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our call today. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Operator\\nWelcome to the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, vice president of investor relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.\\nIn addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\\nSteve Frank -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our chief executive officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S.\\nGAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13th, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin. \\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S.\\nand 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises.\\nWe don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the No. 1 selling OA pain product in Europe.\\nAt Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth.\\nSimilarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain maps. Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism.\\nWe remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.\\nAs we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance.\\nOur dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market.\\nOur focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition.\\nI want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders.\\nWhile there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you. Now let me hand it over to Wetteny.\\nWetteny?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S.\\nand international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animals was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction among both vets and pet owners.\\nOur key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.\\nOur lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals.\\nAdjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter.\\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while international segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%.\\nWe saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.\\nSimparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S.\\nand international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from Draxxin and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims.\\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal pre price buy-in at the end of last year.\\nIn the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.\\nMoving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S.\\nsales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S.\\nsales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S.\\nWe have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%.\\nGrowth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges and in advance of a than expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and a significant advantage of being first to market. Key dermatology products sales in the U.S.\\nwere $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. Simparica franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our U.S.\\ncompanion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.\\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\\nGrowth in our OA pain products was equally driven by full focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis.\\nWe continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness.\\nThis growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio.\\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition-related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation.\\nR&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.\\nAdjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders.\\nFor the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024.\\nPlease note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points.\\nwith significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume.\\nWe expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally.\\nOur current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio.\\nFor livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth.\\nFor companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio.\\nWe expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination animal parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.\\nAdjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix.\\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million.\\nThis is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market.\\nand growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.\\nTo summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future.\\nAs we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nErin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. So can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the U.S. and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter to quarter.\\nAnd then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp-up of Librela that weigh on margins. But can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher-margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer-term margin leverage. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yeah. We were very pleased with how we did with Librela in this first full quarter of launch in Q4.\\nAs you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we -- given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected in line with our expectations. So that makes us really confident as we go into the year.\\nwe're looking at what -- your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clicks. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the No.\\n1 selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the U.S. as well. So we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the U.S.\\nSo I'll let Wetteny take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed, there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond, we do have Librela in 2023, as we've said at Investor Day, if you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand. They started being dilutive to the overall company average, for example, in 2023. As we go through 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below whether you would consider our innovative companion animal products.\\nAnd as we exit '24 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So overall, beyond '24, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect. But I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So that mix will continue to be favorable for us.\\nAnd as we get into the higher levels of production from monoclonal antibodies, they are also accretive to overall margins. And we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023.\\nAnd as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we're positioned to continue to expand.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So it looks like you're guiding back in the analogue math you're guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024.\\nBut you also did finish '23 lower than we would have expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You call out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation.\\nAny way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in '23? And then maybe what some of those onetime headwinds would have as an impact to 2024. Just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela. I don't believe you actually quantified the target.\\nSo I want to -- just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point. is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable. And especially that's for U.S., but then on the OUS side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of the Europe and it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So any color on what's going on internationally? Thanks.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure, Mike. Let me take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So take a look at margins. Indeed, in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion in margins.\\nKeep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact and about 80 of that is from FX. So you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly, a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our lifestyle team in Utah, and look, they've had a great year, and we expect lifestyle continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end.\\nSo that created a little bit of a mix. Yes, and as well as Librela outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit dilutive. So when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting '23. Most of the impact here is coming from FX about 80 basis points.\\nThe other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended FX is that has the impact on our on our finish here. If you take a look at FX, which is clearly nonoperational and you factor nonrecurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition. Those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here.\\nOf course, we don't forecast FX. So what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are. at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024.\\nAnd so that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past, and I will sit here and guess what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024, and that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes. For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue. Price is a pretty significant factor.\\nWe continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of 2 to 3 points. And perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And the Librela with the U.S. launch, clearly is going to be a significant factor.\\nCertainly, $44 million in the quarter and Q4 was, again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So you can model that out in terms of what that would translate to. We're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far as we discussed already.\\nIn international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets in addition to the U.S.\\n$44 million. So I think what we have to really take into account here is as we've been launching in markets. In Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out, you just focus on those markets that we've already launched.\\nWe're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters about give or take. So we're going to be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets.\\nMike Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat.\\nOperator\\nWe'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\\nJon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\nOK. Thanks guys. Good morning. Wendy, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of the easier 1Q '23 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half.\\nSo just -- how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And in the guidance for the full year, maybe GM, we're a little bit below what we were thinking. But SG&A expense despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So maybe you can just talk through those items why we're only seeing seems like low to mid-single-digit SG&A growth year over year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX? And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the U.S.\\n4Q '23 to 1Q '24 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks guys.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, John. If you look in Q1, certainly if you look at companion animal in the U.S., this is an easier comp.\\nWe had destocking in the first quarter last year. clearly something we look to see as an easier comp we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so I think if you look to balance complete the balance, but it's lifestyle growth both in the U.S.\\nas well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So that becomes a heavier I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions -- weather conditions in Australia, etc., are having an impact there. So I think if you balance those out and last point I'll make is, Librela, we are clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year.\\nSo Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Novella accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relative to speaking in Q1. So when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now we did make references to FX.\\nSo from a reported basis, that, again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple of weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. When FX de facto, hopefully, what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with the momentum as we exited Q4 and Q1, again, looking at U.S.\\ncompanion animal, but that's how I think about it. Now is Q1 is going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective, I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stock in that $12 million to $15 million. So even if you had a flat that means you grow by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here.\\nRight now, what I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDave Westenberg -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. So last year, we saw some discounting in front of the next gaurd combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of Elanco's Quattro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just a second one on just the DTC efforts on Librela.\\nI don't think there is DC allowed in Europe. But can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and maybe how that messaging can come out? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year, overall Trio grew 9%.\\nSo we're very pleased with that as we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in Trio for the year. So this obviously underscores everything and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So we do anticipate, obviously, a competitor entering I'm not exactly sure what -- how Elanco's Quattro will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product.\\nThey do mention taper, but you get tapeworm from fleas then we actually control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So we abused to having good competitors, obviously, with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional.\\nBut I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone entree is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market.\\nWhat we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, etc. So as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on what have we learned from Librela in Europe, so we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness.\\nI think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to encouraging them that there is a new product and then they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplift from direct-to-consumer advertising even when it's not branded. So I don't know what you want to add into that?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nLook, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio been performing really well for us in the face of drug competition in the U.S. going to be more pleased. And to be gaining patient share in the face of competition.\\nI think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So look, there'll be some initial heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in with factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't hold in on specific reaction and so on, but we're very confident in our ability to grow continued growth franchise, and we're saying we're going to see mid- to single-digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nNate Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGreat. Good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid- to high single-digit growth for the franchise overall.\\nI guess, specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China. Could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that, that growth is obviously understated given the price -- if you're looking at the pre priced buy-in that we saw in late 2022.\\nAs we look at our guidance for mid- to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the U.S. You have pruritus.\\nThere is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market, seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products.\\nOur products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vest. And we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, build a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet and our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in Apoquel chewable and moving them to chewable pet owners really prefer.\\nWe've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the U.S. And we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term on the long-acting. So we are going to defend this franchise.\\nWe're confident in this franchise, our guidance of mid- to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the U.S. and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring life cycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, sure. And one point on derm of course, we have a mid- to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance. of course, across a broad range of expectation there, there's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, etc., will play into that and the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow.\\nOur franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting to ignore nor improve at least through the first half of our year, and we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, little bit less so into the first half of '24, but still a headwind into the first half of '24.\\nYou continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices are remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So all those factors, of course, long term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade. But in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth.\\nIn fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBalaji Prasad -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. A couple. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points return revenue and 150 basis points on EPS is to be going from here.\\nWhy is FX severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean my general understanding is with $4 billion of -- $4-plus billion of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis received on Librela number. I wanted to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela's as promotion with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points, and what is the current status now with regard to your communication with FDA.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure Balaji, so I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I see you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification, would -- what you're talking about is a request for clarification on our promotional materials.\\nWe just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean this isn't uncommon. So I don't -- that was easily resolved last year, that was a minor issue.\\nBut Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. On currency dynamics. And again, we don't forecast FX. So we tend to report out what we see the impact is.\\nAnd the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina, if you follow Argentina, there have been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August. And there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those clearly is impact on top line that we've talked about. But there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time.\\nSo by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down to bottom line. So combinations volume. Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced in their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they value. That's what you're seeing play out.\\nBut really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\\nBrandon Vazquez -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre priced buying in the quarter. Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that, maybe higher level.\\nIs there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us, you're still spending a lot of money in R&D and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre priced buying in our -- as we exit the year given where what our price increases are going to be I would say, compared to the prior year where there was higher than average reprice buying as in 2022 into 2023, which had the impact on '24, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of reprice buying exiting 2023. And that gave us really First, the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into but also, I would say, our quarter position walking into January 2024, we're certainly in a better position than, say, the prior year.\\nSo we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. And the question with regards to R&D. Obviously, we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health.\\nAnd if you look at the -- how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium and long term. In Animal Health, different than human health, that really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like life cycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apical Chewable, which will significantly support our key brands.\\nWe're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one- to three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long-acting. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term and really important new franchises as well, such as renal, chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes, there's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics as well as behind our livestock business.\\nlooking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nChris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth.\\nI know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. I'm just trying to get more color on what is the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still that capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex U.S.\\nFrom your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm showing a sense of like we're in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex U.S. Thanks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered as we've spoken about many times before to that business. I mean obviously, they're not inconsequential our view of 0% to 1% is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time.\\nSo I think we're really saying it's back to normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the U.S. But I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it.\\nBut we really sort of view the year as you look into the year for although we saw flat vet visits, we spot revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously, overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time. with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, etc. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the U.S., I think we're still early innings.\\nAnd really where I think we see the growth is right now, that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs. I mean, I think, obviously, at least somewhere -- I mean in my 50s, I will say, my hip hurts right now. But everyone doesn't know that it's around me.\\nAnd so the reality is osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're living and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think, is critical. So I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first-line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think we more -- we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise.\\nSo we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Stephen Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nUnknown speaker\\nThis is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First, on Librela. To what degree are U.S.\\ndebt capacity constraints, the headwind to longer-term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home administrative formulation? Thank you.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So that capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on. But I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech.\\nAnd I think the industry is really focused, and we've been partnering with corporates the ABM with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far, globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a U.S. issue, it's global.\\nSo far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second question is with regard to home delivery. You want to take that one?\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock and innovation, not only in our OA pain maps, but across our portfolio, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer-acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela will be the direction that will help with this, even though as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the maps.\\nI think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, etc. And that varies a bit, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\nNavann Ty -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions I have two ones on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela.\\nWith continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&As in addition to the current testing campaign -- and just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025. And then on Trio, can you help us explain the switches from to Mexico plus? Are they mostly from BI's homes like large rather than from Simparica Trio and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly. Thank you.\\nWetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments, and we already started because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing the DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about year and a half or so ago. So we're able to leverage those investments, and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product.\\nThe gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023 and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage above. So 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it's below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see at those innovative levels, which is above -- well above the company. average.\\nSo hopefully, that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth, grew 17% in the U.S. in and we continue to gain patient share, which means, again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe effication has been in the market. for almost four years now.\\nSo we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know if Kristin, you want to add.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nWe're doing quite well of topics U.S. specifically with regards to puppies. I mean puppies are on the Trio label. So I just want to emphasize that.\\nI know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So I mean, really, if you're looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual agent customers to a triple combination and certainly a movement to more people from topical to oral. So there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies to answer that other part of your question.\\nOperator\\nThere seem to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\\nKristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer\\nGreat. Thank you all so much for the questions. And honestly, your continued interest in Zoetis. I want to undergo that the enduring strength of the human animal bond for pet owners expectations of human-quality healthcare for pets and the need for safe and secure food supply all underscore that animal health industry is essential and very durable.\\nWe remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just a line and to grow operational revenue by mid- to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio, and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises. The animal health industry is resilient even in times of uncertainty, and we are poised to navigate these challenges because our portfolio diversity, our commitment to exceptional customer experience, operational excellence, and agility, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in future calls.\\nThanks a must for joining us today, guys. Have a great day.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\n\",\n          \"\\ufeffOperator\\nGood morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.\\nWith the exception of any participant's questions asked, during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, vice president, investor relations.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, chairman and chief executive officer; Bob Funck, executive vice president for finance; and Phil Boudreau, senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results, as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time to position the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier, given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing experienced a slowdown to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world placed a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffered during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient.\\nIt was also during this time that we created a multibillion dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders. But we knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead.\\nWe pulled forward our accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale-down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company. Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions.\\nAnd this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution.\\nAnd in medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals, along with several new opportunities, to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year.\\nSales, excluding COVID testing, grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11%, higher than our original guidance of high single-digit growth. Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic. Turning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecasted sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business. I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S.\\nwas driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader. International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\\nTurning to established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results. Moving to diagnostics, growth in rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing.\\nThe flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering. Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations.\\nThe system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales, led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis.\\nIn heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. So, in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year.\\nWe outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil?\\nPhil Boudreau -- Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which as expected reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for 2024, today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024.\\nFor the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\n\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice end to the year here. So, Robert, you know, pre-COVID Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically. As you mentioned, you're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base.\\nWhat has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions and I'll leave it there for my one question. Thank you.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and, quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business, I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these four business, and their underlying attractiveness still is, you know, is very sustainable. So, strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these four segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in.\\nSo, I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging, you know, geographies and different markets.\\nAnd they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think you know, even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their margin profile by 300 basis points. So, a pretty strong position, strong team. And then, you know, we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which, historically, hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets.\\nIt's probably been more of a developed market place. So, I think that's going to, you know, provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think, did an incredible job here, as we said at the beginning of last year, regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product.\\nBut even adult -- our adult business. Our adult business has increased $1 billion, you know, since pre-pandemic. And it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion growing high single digits.\\nThere's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that, you know, command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also. Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well.\\nWe've talked about, you know, our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio and, quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. And our rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to, you know, put through those instruments so -- and then, medical devices, you know, historically, was in that high single digit growth.\\nI think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-sized business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like [Inaudible] or EP, structural heart, ADC, I mean those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices, our CRM and vascular businesses that were, you know, showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4. With CRM, I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology.\\nOn vascular, it's been a combination of adding and organically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segment. So, I think that's really, you know, in a nutshell, across all these very four attractive segments, we've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you know, you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth. And they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten, you know, more growth opportunities within.\\nSo, I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about, you know, accelerating sales but, you know, not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. You know, our core business grew EPS last year, you know, 40-plus percent.\\nWe're forecasting double-digit earnings-per-share growth, you know, this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So, I'd say, yeah, you know, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics.\\nBut, you know, we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have. On the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range. But it's only January, so I think this is a good starting point.\\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nSuper helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nHi, Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and I echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. I was hoping to just follow up on your comments, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. You know, Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally.\\nBut was hoping to just -- thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business and that 30 to 50 basis point range, was hoping you just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in '24 and into the outyears? Thanks for taking the question.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre-pandemic level.\\nAnd I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we managed, you know, very well strategically the spending piece of it. You know, we accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then, we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was, you know, was growing pretty significantly here. So, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line.\\nAnd that is, you know, I think about our big five activities this year in the company. You know, and we can do all five of them at the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. You know, we're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, you know, roughly around 75 basis points.\\nAnd, you know, there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So, you know, every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis, they all get reported out.\\nSo, there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs. Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So, you know, whether it's commodity costs, you know, freight and distribution, you know, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now, and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, you know, turning into tailwinds. So, that helps.\\nAnd then, the other part here is just, you know, I'd say portfolio mix. So, as some of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher-margin businesses. And, you know, they provide that, you know, that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So, I think this provides a nice -- you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year.\\nBut I expect, over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic -- you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's for me it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. You know, we could target, you know, 50, 75. You know, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want.\\nBut, you know, that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to do -- to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. So, I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. So, our big opportunity here is gross margin, and, you know, we're all over it.\\nJosh Jennings -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches.\\nSo, we'd love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the U.S. EP business as we see some PFA launches this year? Thanks for taking the questions.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Well, I think we've showed a pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition. It's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story.\\nU.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP.\\nBut the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than more than offset that. So, it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So, you know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think, is at the core.\\nYou know, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is, you know, the flexible tip combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's, you know, outcomes for the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world. And then, on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers.\\nAnd, yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So, I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth. As we look to, you know, more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S., listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology.\\nI think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake in usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first -- at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment. And then, from there, then kind of moving past that.\\nSo, you know, right now, I think -- I guess that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that, you know, it will follow a similar pattern. And then, the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground, you know, with the technology.\\nMarie Thibault -- BTIG -- Analyst\\nThank you, Robert.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, maybe I could ask on Libre. You know, this is the most successful medical device.\\nAt the conference just a few weeks ago, in San Fran, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward and targets. You know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in '24 and beyond. And one question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data, it's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales, or at least prescriptions are flattening out yet the sales keep growing.\\nHow do we think about the discrepancy there? And how big is the Medicare DME business and, you know, the growth we're getting there from basal? Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Strong growth in Q4, under 1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%.\\nAnd I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But, you know, being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\\nYou know, the growth is going to come from, I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, I mean, a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, OK, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us, but -- and I also think it's multiyear.\\nSo, I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely, you know, two plus-years easily. And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you reference IQVIA, Ravi.\\nSeven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. So, it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where, you know, that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution in growth.\\nI think right now, in the U.S, most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private commercial. Medicare represents about a third of the market. So, I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the build the awareness, you know, build the traveling experience with primary care.\\nAnd that's what we're doing, that's what we have been doing quite frankly for some time. So, it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. And like I said, you know, easily two-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have Robbie, is, you know, looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access, which is that of, you know, pump connectivity, I think this represents a great opportunity for us.\\nIf you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You've got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year. And that patient segment has -- you know, we haven't been able to target it. But now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us.\\nYou know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? Recently, there was an independent third-party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head-to-head study that was published a few weeks ago showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's marred. So, I look at that and I say, OK, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the, you know, best solution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment.\\nSo, I look at the basal, I look at the pump. It's probably good drivers for us, you know, in '24, '25. But, you know, we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. To your question on IQVIA, you know, I think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market.\\nSo, you know, the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So, maybe that's what you're seeing.\\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nGreat. Appreciate the thoughts.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since this story seems to be very much about wine growth, I haven't heard you reference the Fab 5, one of my favorite analogies in a long time.\\nSo, just wanted to -- and maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab 5 and where, you know, how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth, for 2024? Thanks so much.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products. And we didn't think about calling them that because there was going to be a flash in the pan for, you know, one or two years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company, you know, over the next few years.\\nAnd, you know, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth, and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about, you know, about a point of growth, total Abbott, you know, contribution. So, they're definitely stepping up. And I'd say some of them, I would call market-creating opportunities.\\nTricuspid, I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, you know, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, you know, generating referral pathways. You know, we know how to do this. And we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, you know, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to, you know, market expansion development and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion.\\nAnd, you know, these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments, you know, that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVI space, AVEIR in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that, you know, we're coming in and will have different value propositions. I think AVEIR's got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market.\\nAnd the value proposition for AVEIR, I think, is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implant or to the patient. So, I expect a lot from AVEIR in terms of growth. I expect a lot from, you know, Navitor. And, you know, we're going to be expanding, so we'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan.\\nAnd so, we're investing in those areas. And, yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it, and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year, and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company.\\nSo, you know, that being said, I will say, you know, those are great products, and they take a lot of focus. But we still have -- you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users, this year also. You know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution.\\nWe put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars, in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre. We're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So, yeah, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions.\\nBut there's a lot in the chamber here. And I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline.\\nDanielle Antalffy -- UBS -- Analyst\\nThank you. Very thorough. Thank you so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year, or nice end to last year, too. So, here's a question I have. In nutrition, you've done a great job of, sounds like, returning to normalcy.\\nI'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track, or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single-digit segment growth category. Thanks.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Yeah, I think kudos to the team here. We set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year, to get to market leadership. In our October call, we had already confirmed that.\\nAnd I'd say over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the No. 2. Yeah, I mean, I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, you know, given the strength of the portfolio of the team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share.\\nYou know, I don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio. So, I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have pre-pandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can, you know, be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down.\\nAnd I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position, with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on healthcare and on nutrition. So, I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher-end 6% range going forward. But I think, right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial-year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range and then as we move into next year, you know, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the adult segment and what is that going to do for us.\\nJoanne Wuensch -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThank you very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Robert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M&A.\\nLooking at the balance sheet, phenomenal position. You at least have a minimum of 20 billion of firepower. Abbott hasn't done any large deals in the last few years. So, my question is, how do you see the opportunity for larger-size deals? What is Abbott's appetite for a larger size, more meaningful transaction?\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet, and it provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So, that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top-line gaps that might be there.\\nSo, that allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then, like you said, you've done the math. We've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good.\\nYou know, profitability matters. You know, earnings matter. And, you know, when you get into these larger-size deals, you know, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top-line play. I think they're harder nowadays.\\nYou know, you look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together, you know, spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought, you know, this business would, you know, would impact the company. So, I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital.\\nAnd -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top-line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to fill a top-line gap.\\nVijay Kumar -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOperator, we'll take one more question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. And our last question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nHi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some of the companies are kind of calling out above-normal growth.\\nSo, curious, Robert, if you look at your med device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated, you know, catch-ups still coming through? Or do you think this is kind of more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious in some of your thoughts on the overall market.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, I don't think that that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio, I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So, I think there was some disruption, we've talked about it, in some parts of -- some procedures that require a little bit more pre-op planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean, I think those -- that, combined with the labor shortages that occurred, you know, 2022, I think that that that probably slowed a few of them down. But I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that.\\nI just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see, you know, procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in, you know, CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, too, so -- we've seen that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis. A lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our core lab business is actually in the hospital. So, we also get to see that, too.\\nAnd, you know, I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So, we try and triangulate this. I just see this as, you know, procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients, I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve.\\nSome are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and, you know, market positions, etc. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here.\\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\\nRobert Ford -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nOK. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023 in many ways. It sort of represented this transition year regarding, you know, the coming down of COVID.\\nI think we did a really good job at managing, you know, the scale-up and the scale-down. A lot of healthcare companies actually participated in trying to solve, you know, the COVID problem. And I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now a transition from being driven by COVID testing to, once again, being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company.\\nWe deliver double-digit organic sales growth on every base business on every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline, we talked a bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024.\\nAnd as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January, so we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year.\\nMike Comilla -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nOK. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m.\\nCentral Time today on Abbott investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\\nOperator\\nThank you.

        "The analysis of bigrams, which were phrases from the earnings call was used for this Random Forest model. This model, fine-tuned through grid search, achieved an accuracy of 41.67% with its optimal parameters set to {'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_leaf': 4, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}. Despite achieving a precision of 41.67%, its recall was remarkably high at 100%, leading to an F1 score of 0.59. This indicates that while the model was exceptionally good at identifying all instances of a particular class, reflecting a perfect recall rate, it faltered in precision. This discrepancy suggests that the model frequently misclassified instances from other classes. The likely cause for this imbalance is the model's difficulty in distinguishing between the nuanced phrases common in earnings calls, as evidenced by a confusion matrix where predictions were predominantly biased towards a single class."

Precision scores indicate that it correctly identifies stock price decreases 67% of the time and price increases 60% of the time. The recall rates show it captures 50% of actual decreases and 75% of actual increases. Overall, with F1-scores of 57% for decreases and 67% for increases, the model demonstrates a balanced performance in identifying both positive and negative price movements."

A lower MSE generally indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, but because the inputs of the model are all very close to 0, and there are a lot of features, it makes sense that the MSE is very low, making the number potentially misleading."

In the context of predicting stock price direction, this means that the average squared difference between the actual stock prices and the predicted stock prices by the Ridge Regression model is approximately 0.0002793. A lower MSE generally indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, but because the inputs of the model are all very close to 0, and there are a lot of features, it makes sense that the MSE is very low, making the number potentially misleading."

        "The project provides fascinating insights into the predictive power of textual data extracted from healthcare sector earnings call transcripts. By employing natural language processing techniques to convert complex financial jargon and nuanced speech into structured data, the project was able to capture influential factors that may not be immediately apparent from quantitative data alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the approaches in this project was the use of topic modeling, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which identified prevalent topics within the earnings calls. This unsupervised learning technique was crucial for understanding the thematic structures influencing investor sentiment and stock price movement, such as discussions on operational efficiency or clinical trial outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Complementing the LDA's insights, various predictive models were trained and evaluated. The Random Forest model, a robust ensemble learning method capable of handling the high dimensionality of text data, showed potential despite its modest accuracy. Its ability to break down the decision-making process into an ensemble of decision trees made it a valuable asset for feature importance analysis, though its precision was somewhat limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "To refine the performance of the models, including Random Forest and logistic regression, GridSearchCV was utilized to methodically search for the best hyperparameters. This cross-validation tool helped in systematically exploring a wide range of combinations and brought to light the best-performing models based on the given evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the project's results emphasize the power of ensemble learning. The AutoGluon framework's Weighted Ensemble model achieved a higher validation score than individual models, which indicates that the combination of different models can capture various aspects of the data that single models might miss. The ensemble method effectively consolidates predictions, smoothing out the biases and variances of individual models, thus providing a more balanced and generalizable prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, logistic regression, a more traditional statistical model often used for binary classification, was applied to this text data. Its interpretability was a key advantage, allowing for a clear understanding of the relationship between features like 'EPS' or 'Financial Performance' and stock price predictions. The logistic regression model's parameters were carefully tuned to enhance its predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The insights from text data, when combined with traditional financial metrics, provided a comprehensive view of the underlying patterns and trends that could influence stock prices post-earnings calls. The integration of text analysis with machine learning models underscores the value of blending quantitative and qualitative analyses to form a holistic view of the financial market's behavior, particularly in a sector as dynamic as healthcare.\n",
